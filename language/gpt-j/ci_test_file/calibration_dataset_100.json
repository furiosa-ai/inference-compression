        "input": "Dr. Conrad Murray was sentenced Tuesday to four years in the Los Angeles County jail -- the maximum sentence allowed under the law -- in the death of Michael Jackson. He may serve no more than two, however. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor, in a lengthy statement delivered before sentencing Murray for involuntary manslaughter, said he felt a significant responsibility to determine the appropriate sentence, utilizing his \"sense of fairness and decency.\" \"There are those who feel Dr. Murray is a saint,\" Judge Pastor said. \"There are those who feel Dr. Murray is the devil. He's neither. He's a human being. He stands convicted of the death of another human being.\" Automatic credit for good behavior lowers the actual time served to two years, which puts his projected release date in late 2013, Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Overheard on CNN.com: Is 4-year sentence fair? Murray is not eligible for early release electronic monitoring or house arrest, which some county prisoners get under a federal court order aimed at reducing jail overcrowding, Whitmore said.  \"He does not meet our requirements for any kind of home monitoring,\" he said. Members of Jackson's family, who sat in court for Tuesday's sentencing, appeared pleased with the judge's decision to ignore defense pleas for leniency. A statement from the family, read in court by a lawyer, said they were \"not here to seek revenge,\" but they wanted a sentence that \"reminds physicians that they cannot sell their services to the highest bidder and cast aside their Hippocratic oath to do no harm.\" It included a message to the judge from Jackson's three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket. \"We will grow up without a father, our best friend, our playmate and our dad,\" the children said. Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff acknowledged that it was unlikely Pastor would accept probation for Murray, but he still made a case for community service over time behind bars. \"He could do things for the community on probation that he could never do sitting in that little room,\" Chernoff said. Even without jail time, Chernoff said, he will suffer the rest of his life because of the loss of his medical career and the stigma of the conviction. \"Whether he is a barista the rest of his life, whether he is a greeter at Walmart, he's still going to be the man who killed Michael Jackson for the rest of his life,\" Chernoff said. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren, arguing for the maximum four years in jail, said Murray was \"playing Russian roulette with Michael Jackson's life every single night,\" by using the surgical anesthetic propofol to put him to sleep in \"a reckless, obscene manner.\" Murray showed his lack of remorse or acceptance of his personal responsibility in an interview nine days before he was found guilty, Walgren said. \"I don't feel guilty because I did not do anything wrong,\" Murray said in a documentary aired days after he was convicted. Pastor delivered a 30-minute explanation of why he was sentencing Murray to the maximum jail time, even though the doctor was technically eligible for probation. Murray's \"faux documentary\" made it appear he was just a \"bystander\" in Jackson's death who was \"entrapped\" and \"betrayed\" by his patient, Pastor said. \"Yikes!  Talk about blaming the victim,\" he said.  \"Not only isn't there any remorse, there's umbrage and outrage on the part of Dr. Murray against the decedent, without any, any indication of the slightest involvement in this case.\" Pastor said that while he had considered the entire \"book\" of Murray's life, he also had \"read the book of Michael Jackson's life.\" \"Regrettably, as far as Dr. Murray is concerned, the most significant chapter, as it relates to this case, is the chapter involving the treatment, or lack of treatment, of Michael Jackson.\" Jackson died \"not because of an isolated one-off occurrence or incident,\" Pastor said. \"He died because of a totality of circumstances which are directly attributable to Dr. Murray ... because of a series of decisions that Dr. Murray made.\" Murray, he said, became involved in \"a cycle of horrible medicine.\" He cited Murray's \"pattern of deceit and lies. That pattern was to assist Dr. Murray.\" A tape recording of Jackson's slurred voice was Murray's \"insurance policy,\" Pastor said. \"It was designed to record his patient surreptitiously at that patient's most vulnerable point. I can't even imagine that happening to any of us because of the horrific violation of trust.\" He said he wondered whether that tape would have been offered for sale, had Jackson not died and a rift had developed between the two in the future. One of the 12 jurors who found Murray guilty said in an interview airing Tuesday on HLN's \"Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell,\" that the recording did not play into the verdict. \"We talked about that audio a little bit,\" Debbie Franklin, known as \"Juror 5,\" said.  \"We didn't really understand why it was presented. I still do not understand what that was about.\" Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter three weeks ago after a trial in which prosecutors successfully argued that Murray's reckless use of propofol to help Jackson sleep, without proper monitoring equipment, led to the singer's death. \"We had decided the three issues we were going to focus on were the not calling 911, not having the medical equipment and him leaving the room,\" Franklin said.  \"That was the bottom line for this case.\" Testimony during the trial revealed that Murray gave propofol nearly every night in the two months before the singer's death on June 25, 2009, as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts set for London the next month. The judge set a hearing for January 23 to decide on the prosecution's request that Murray be ordered to pay Jackson's estate and his children more than $100 million in restitution for the \"wage and profits lost,\" as provided under California's \"victim's bill of rights\" law. The singer's \"estate estimates Michael Jackson's projected earnings for the 50-show O2 concert series to be $100 million,\" the prosecutors said. With nearly $2 million in funeral expenses and 10% interest added each year, the prosecution is asking Pastor to order Murray to pay Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson more than $120 million in restitution. While it is doubtful that Murray, who is unlikely to ever practice medicine again, could pay very much of that sum, it could prevent him from reaping financial benefits from any books, interviews or film projects in the future.",

        "input": "Roughly half the schedulers at multiple Veterans Affairs hospitals said they received instructions from supervisors to falsify data and hide the true time it took patients to be seen by a doctor after making an appointment, new details from an internal VA audit show. Schedulers said supervisors directed them to manipulate information so their centers could meet performance goals, which would help top officials get bonuses, according to documents obtained by CNN. The new information also provided to Congress this week includes updates from specific VA hospitals that were not included in an internal audit released last month by the embattled agency. The ongoing saga involves multiple investigations into delayed care, potentially with deadly results, alarming management shortcomings and a culture that was said to have compromised the mission of providing prompt and effective medical care to millions of veterans, some of them returning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. New VA secretary confirmed . VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned over the scandal in May. His replacement, Robert McDonald, was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday unanimously. The former corporate CEO and ex-Army officer has pledged to swiftly introduce reforms. Under pressure from constituents back home and most members facing voters in November, Congress is poised to approve a $17 billion bipartisan proposal before the week is out. It would allow the agency to hire more medical staff, lease new facilities, and give veterans the opportunity to seek care outside the VA system. It would also allow the VA secretary to more easily fire top officials. Details of delayed care were first reported by CNN in an investigation of two VA hospitals in the Southeast. Since, CNN reporting has expanded to include more hospitals and details of delayed care and allegations that up to 40 deaths were tied to the problem. Congress comes up with a deal on veterans . Greater range of problems . While the Phoenix VA medical center has received the most national scrutiny, the new information shows in greater depth a range of problems affecting numerous facilities nationwide. VA hospitals in Montgomery, Alabama, Clarksburg, West Virginia, and White City, Oregon, were among the worst cited in the new information. About 50% of schedulers at those facilities reported being told by their superiors to falsify data. Moreover, schedulers in Washington, Richmond, Gainesville, Florida, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and elsewhere used \"outside tracking logs\" to hide long delays in care by not properly recording information in the scheduling system, the documents showed. Numerous other VA medical centers may have improperly used \"paper wait lists\" or excel spreadsheets to hide delays, according to the new internal audit details. Data from the audit released last month found that 13% of schedulers surveyed nationally said they were directed by hospital administrators to enter appointment dates that were different from those requested by a veteran. But the newly released data showed 55 of the VA medical centers audited had more than 13% of schedulers reporting such direction, the documents showed. Bad VA care may have killed more than 1,000 veterans, senator's report says . Coaching schedulers . Scheduling staff training has been controversial throughout recent investigations of VA management. The audit also showed that half of schedulers surveyed could not remember the date of their last training. The findings also showed there were attempts to coach and prepare staff and schedulers in a number of cases before they were questioned by auditors. House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller said any VA administrator who ordered employees to purposely manipulate patient wait times should be immediately fired. \"The environment in today's Veterans Health Administration is one in which some VA executives are so driven in their quest for performance bonuses, promotions and power that they are willing to lie, cheat and put the health of the veterans they were hired to serve at risk,\" Miller said. Gingrich Opinion: We owe our veterans real change . VA takes action . The VA said in a statement on its website on Tuesday that it had proposed \"a series of disciplinary\" actions against six employees in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Fort Collins, Colorado, as a result of the audit. \"Employees who have been found to have manipulated data, withheld accurate information from their supervisors, and affected the timeliness of care veterans receive do not reflect VA's values, and their actions will not be tolerated,\" said Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson. Carolyn Lerner, head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, said, \"We are encouraged by the VA's action in response to Office of Special Counsel's reports regarding whistleblower disclosures of manipulated wait-time data that masked scheduling problems at the VA's Cheyenne and Fort Collins facilities.\" The office is charged with representing whistleblowers across the country. Who is Bob McDonald? Veterans waiting longer for cancer care . 'Corrosive culture,' weak leadership cripple VA, report says .",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Real Madrid reduced Barcelona's Spanish league lead to two points with a comfortable 2-0 victory at home to lowly Levante on Saturday, reaching a remarkable milestone for coach Jose Mourinho. First-half goals from Karim Benzema and Ricardo Carvalho were enough to give Mourinho's team a 19th victory in 24 La Liga games this season. The victory extended Real's unbeaten home La Liga run under Mourinho to 12 matches -- now 148 in total since his only career home league defeat when in charge of Porto on February 23, 2002. Mourinho has carried his incredible record through spells with English club Chelsea and European champions Inter Milan into his first season at the Santiago Bernabeu. Spanish titleholders Barcelona will seek to bounce back from Tuesday's Champions League defeat by Arsenal and last weekend's surprise draw with Sporting Gijon when Athletic Bilbao visit the Camp Nou on Sunday. Benzema, meanwhile, staked his claim for a starting place against his former club Lyon this coming Tuesday, when Real travel to France seeking revenge for last season's last-16 defeat in Europe's top club competition. Lyon warm up for Real clash with win . The 23-year-old has been vying for a place with loan signing Emmanuel Adebayor in the absence of the injured Gonzalo Higuain, and he scored his third league goal this season from close range after a superb run down the right by winger Angel Di Maria. Real dominated after that sixth-minute opener, and the second goal came four minutes before halftime when veteran Portugal defender Carvalho diverted in a vicious Cristiano Ronaldo free-kick for his third La Liga goal since leaving Chelsea in August. Second-half substitute Adebayor thought he had made it 3-0 in time added on, but Ronaldo was ruled to have been offside as he sought to pounce on a blocked shot from another replacement, Mesut Ozil. \"I liked that my team played a serious match. These games ahead of Champions League matches can be complicated because players may focus more on the European competition,\" Mourinho told reporters. \"The team played well and was very focused. We knew Levante would make it tough. They were organized in defense, but we scored early and had things under control. Winning and resting players is what mattered.\" The defeat left Levante two points above the bottom three, with the Valencia-based team hoping to avoid an immediate return to the second division. Third-placed Valencia lost ground on Madrid following a 0-0 draw at home to Sporting Gijon, who ended the day above 16th-placed Levante on goal difference. That result means fellow Champions League hopefuls Villarreal can draw level on 48 points with a win at home to bottom club Malaga on Sunday. Fifth-placed Atletico Madrid won 1-0 at Real Zaragoza in Saturday's late match, thanks to Sergio Aguero's second-half winner. The Argentine striker broke the deadlock with a flash of brilliance in the 65th minute as he received Diego Forlan's pass, burst into the penalty box and fired a low shot across the keeper and into the far corner. Zaragoza could have snatched a point, but Nigerian striker Ikechukwu Uche and on-loan Argentine midfielder Nicolas Bertolo both saw late efforts rebound off the Madrid crossbar. Zaragoza remained a point above third-bottom Osasuna, who host sixth-placed Espanyol on Sunday.",

        "input": "(CNN)  -- The head of the U.N. Children's Fund has expressed concern over a Saudi judge's refusal for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8-year-old girl and a 47-year-old man. UNICEF's Ann Veneman said consent cannot be free if either party is too young to make an informed decision. \"Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework, the marriage of a child is a violation of that child's rights,\" said Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF. \"The right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consent cannot be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision.\" The most recent ruling, in which the judge upheld his original verdict, was handed down Saturday in the Saudi city of Onaiza, where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl's mother, seeking a divorce for her daughter. Have your say by clicking here . A relative said the judge, Sheikh Habib al-Habib, \"stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty.\" The family member, who requested anonymity, added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter. The case, which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups, came to light in December when al-Habib declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality. The judge ruled that the girl's mother -- who is separated from her father -- was not the girl's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court, Abdullah al-Jutaili, the mother's attorney, told CNN at the time. The girl's father, according to the lawyer, arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man, who is a close friend of his. At the time of the initial verdict, the judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili told CNN. The judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty, she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court, the lawyer said. Last month, an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh declined to certify the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib's verdict, and sent the case back to him for reconsideration. Under the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect, but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing. The appeals court in Riyadh will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month, according to the relative. The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently. While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages, the kingdom's top cleric has said that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. \"It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,\" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in remarks last January, according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. \"A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong, and they are being unfair to her.\" Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry. \"We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,\" he said, according to the newspaper. \"We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women.\" Sharia law is Islamic law. Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism. CNN was unable to reach government officials for comment. Christoph Wilcke, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, told CNN in December that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages. \"We've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men,\" Wilcke said. Wilcke said that although Saudi ministries might make decisions designed to protect children, \"It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts, and in many realms beyond the court.\" In December, Zuhair al-Harithi, a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission, said his organization is fighting against child marriages. \"The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia,\" al-Harithi said. \"Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed.\" He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place. Wajeha al-Huwaider, co-founder of the Society of Defending Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, told CNN that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to \"keep us backward and in the dark ages.\" She said the marriages cause girls to \"lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression.\"",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Suspected Somali pirates hijacked a Greek-owned bulk carrier Wednesday with 22 crew members aboard, according to the European Union's Naval Force for Somalia. MV Filitsa was seized in the early morning about 460 miles (740 kilometers) northeast of the Seychelles as it headed toward Durban, South Africa, according to a news release from EU NAVFOR Somalia. The Marshall Island-flagged carrier -- with three Greek and 19 Filipino crew members -- \"has now turned around and is heading north,\" it said. The bulk carrier has a deadweight of more than 23,000 tons. There have been more than 100 pirate attacks and at least 39 hijackings off the east Africa this year, according to EU NAVFOR. In late October, Somali pirates seized a private yacht in the Indian Ocean, taking Paul and Rachel Chandler hostage. They have demanded a $7 million ransom for the British couple's release, but the government has refused to pay as a matter of long-standing policy. Two vessels were attacked the day after the Chandlers set sail. One of them -- a cargo ship -- was successfully boarded and seized off the Seychelles, while the other fought off its attackers near the Kenyan coast. Pirates are still holding a Spanish fishing boat, the Alakrana, which they seized on October 2 off Somalia's coast. Days later, they transferred three of the fishing boat's 36 crew members to land. Two pirate suspects had left the Alakrana in a small vessel heading toward land, authorities said, and the Spanish military swooped in to stop them on the high seas. They were later brought to Madrid, where a judge has charged them with piracy and kidnapping. The pirates holding the crew have demanded Spain release the two suspects. Spain is part of the European Union task force against piracy in the Indian Ocean off Somalia. The Spanish parliament last January agreed to increase Spain's presence with up to 395 troops and assets, including a frigate and aircraft. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report .",

        "input": "(CNN) -- A Texas grand jury declined to issue charges Thursday in a November 2012 deadly collision between a freight train and a parade float that killed four veterans and injured more than a dozen people, Assistant District Attorney Eric Kalenak of Midland County said. The accident happened on November 15 during the \"Hunt for Heroes\" parade to honor members of the U.S. military. The last flatbed truck in the parade was crossing the tracks when an eastbound Union Pacific train slammed into it, Midland police said. An attorney representing Smith Industries, the owner of the truck that served as the float, identified the driver as Dale Andrew Hayden. Civil litigation, however, is pending as the family of at least one deceased victim and several surviving victims, including one left paralyzed, are suing the railroad and Smith Industries, according to the website of the law firm Glasheen, Valles & Inderman in Lubbock, Texas. A second suit on behalf of families of two deceased veterans was filed in Dallas against the railroad, the law firm said. \"Of the twelve families who were on the float stuck by the train, nine have filed suit,\" the law firm said in a January announcement. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board said the grade crossing warning system, which consists of a bell, lights and a gate, operated as designed, giving a 20-second warning of the train's arrival. But the truck entered the crossing and the gate lowered, tipping over flag stands on the float. The board re-created the accident as part of an investigation. An NTSB board member said the south traffic light at the grade crossing turned green 21 seconds before the train's arrival at the crossing, as designed, to allow traffic time to clear the crossing. At 20 seconds before the collision, the bells and lights on the mast activated, in keeping with the minimum time under federal law. Those killed were identified as Marine Corps Chief Warrant Officer 3 Gary Stouffer, 37; Army Sgt. Maj. Lawrence Boivin, 47; Army Sgt. Joshua Michael, 34; and Army Sgt. Maj. William Lubbers, 43.

        "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Control tower tapes reveal that the pilot of presidential hopeful Barack Obama's plane told air traffic controllers there was an emergency when he made an unscheduled landing last month in St. Louis, Missouri. Barack Obama's plane had to make an unscheduled landing on July 7 in St. Louis, Missouri. On July 7 the Midwest Airlines MD-81 made an unscheduled landing during the flight from Chicago, Illinois, to Charlotte, North Carolina. The owner of the plane initially said the landing was not caused by an emergency. However the tapes, released to ABC News through a Freedom of Information Act request, contradict that report. ABC first reported on the tapes on Thursday. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown told CNN Thursday evening that preliminary information for incidents is often incomplete or incorrect.  Watch what the tapes revealed » . According to the tapes, the pilot told an FAA air traffic controller that he had limited ability to move the plane's nose up and down. \"We have limited pitch authority at flight levels; we're descending to see if we can regain pitch authority,\" the pilot told the air traffic controller. \"At this time we would like to declare this an emergency and also have CFR (fire and rescue equipment) standing by in St. Louis,\" the pilot said. The pilot remained calm throughout the recording. Midwest Airlines acknowledged at the time that the pilot had detected a control problem in the pitch of the plane after an emergency evacuation chute opened in the aircraft's tail cone while in flight. Normally, the chute deploys only after landing and after the tail cone pops off. The pitch, or angle of the nose of an airplane, affects the pilot's ability to control the plane. The airline said the pilot had \"full authority of the aircraft.\" According to the tapes, the pilot said he regained control as the plane began to descend into St. Louis. \"We had a pitch authority problem, now that we have come down to a lower altitude it seems to have rectified itself. We do have pitch control of the aircraft at this time,\" he said. Fire trucks met the aircraft when it landed at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. After the plane landed, Obama told reporters the plane landed because of a mechanical problem and noted it marked the first time he had had to do so. \"Just thought we'd spice things up a little bit today,\" he joked. \"Anytime a pilot says that something's not working the way its supposed to, then, you know, you make sure you tighten your seat belt. Everything seemed under control, the pilots knew what they were doing.\" The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident, said last month that there was no evidence of tampering. An \"examination of the hardware did not reveal any evidence of missing components, nor any evidence of tampering,\" the board said. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- As has frequently been the case in the last two-and-a-half years, I found myself this past weekend caught in an intense conversation about the ongoing civil war in Syria. This time it was with a supporter of the al-Assad government. He was relentless, insisting that there was no choice but victory, at any cost, especially since the government has been facing foreign fighters from \"83 countries.\" It's a common refrain I've heard in different variations from all sides of the conflict -- there is no choice but victory. As the world debates the efficacy of a military strike against the al-Assad government in response to its use of chemical weapons on civilians, the fighting on the ground shows no signs of abating. It is clear that the Syrian people are caught between a zero-sum political game being played by the regime and rebels, and their respective backers. Despite lofty rhetoric from a number of countries, diplomatic efforts towards a political solution could have been more vigorous. Opinion: Syria a distraction from real U.S. challenges . Calling for an immediate cease-fire on all sides is the only path towards peace. But will the United States and other key players go down that road? The Syrian uprising began in March 2011, partly in response to the imprisonment and brutal treatment of teenagers in the southern city of Daraa, who had tagged some buildings with anti-government graffiti. Initially, the protesters avoided mentioning dictator Bashar al-Assad by name. But the demonstrations quickly intensified in the face of continued government crackdowns. By August of the same year, over 2,000 Syrians had been killed and the security apparatus of the regime was out in full force, attempting to crush any dissent, peaceful or otherwise through the dastardliest of means. It was no surprise then that the standoff turned violent, as ragtag militias formed to contest government forces. Soon, there was an influx of weapons from neighboring Iraq and distant Libya, as well as foreign reinforcements on the side of the fragmented rebel fighters. By the spring of 2012, the conflict had clearly transformed into a civil war. Since then, the violence has only escalated and the death toll climbed, as the battles have moved from city to city across the country. Entire neighborhoods in Homs, Aleppo, Hama, and elsewhere have been destroyed to rubble. Four questions for backers of Syria mission . The al-Assad government ultimately bears responsibility for the conflict and most of the deaths. However, both sides have committed crimes against humanity. With over 100,000 Syrians dead and millions more displaced internally or as refugees in neighboring countries, the United States, Britain, Russia, China and others have mostly looked on. Instead of bringing the contesting forces to the table to force them to a solution, the United States and Russia and their regional allies continue to send money and arms into the conflict. When was the last time President Obama called for an immediate cease-fire? When was the last time that the U.S. and Russia said simply and with integrity: Stop the violence. Opinion: A U.S. strike would be self-wounding . This call has been missing for fear it could undermine the rebels (or for Russia, the regime). Nowhere was this more apparent than in the battle for Qusayr, which unfolded in front of the world's eyes earlier in the summer, with Hezbollah forces buttressing the al-Assad regime on one side and foreign fighters helping the opposition on the other side. The United Nation envoys, including Kofi Annan and Lakdar Brahimi, have tried to facilitate talks, but with little result, mostly because they were sent to Syria with their hands tied behind their back. Without the political backing from the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, what authority could their initiatives have? We cannot give up on the political process and negotiations, even if the U.S. carries out a military strike, even if there are countless bombings in coming weeks, and even if we can only achieve a brief reprieve from the violence. Opinion: On Syria, Obama must show strong grip . We need to revisit the Geneva discussions, which began in 2012 and outlined roughly a \"transition plan.\" There's also the oft-touted Geneva 2 meeting -- which has yet to be scheduled -- where a future power-sharing agreement in Syria would be discussed. The Geneva 2 meeting would bring together key constituents, including the rebels and the regime. While this process, held under the auspices of the U.N., is far from perfect and may well be a long shot, it offers the best chance towards a political solution to the Syrian conflict.

Oscar Eugene Richardson, 61, was arrested Saturday in Ridgedale, Missouri, as a result of information received through a police hot line, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the state Department of Corrections said. He is the first fugitive captured as part of the Florida \"12 Days of Fugitives\" campaign. \"Richardson is the oldest case among the dozen escapees and it is fitting that justice caught up with him first,\" said Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey. Richardson escaped from the Kissimmee Work Release center in March 1979 after serving less than two years of his 10-year sentence, police said. He had robbed a Tampa, Florida, drugstore in January 1977, holding two employees at gunpoint as he demanded money from the store's safe. Two months later he robbed a convenience store in Tampa, holding the clerk at gunpoint and demanding she fill a bag with money, authorities said. He fled but was apprehended minutes later. At the time of his arrest Saturday, Richardson was living under the alias Eugene Ward and using a false Social Security number, officials said. Police believe he had been living in the same area of Missouri for many years. He was arrested by a U.S. Marshals Service task force. The 12 Days of Fugitives campaign, launched December 7, is aimed at Florida's oldest and most violent prison escapees, the departments' statement said. Newspapers are featuring the fugitives in print and online photo galleries and the Florida Outdoor Advertising Association and its member companies are providing donated space on billboards. \"The campaign is designed to reach the public during the holiday season, when investigators believe the wanted men are most likely to contact friends, family and loved ones,\" the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said. More than $22,000 in reward money is available -- up to $2,500 per fugitive -- for information leading to their capture. The money is provided by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Department of Corrections and the Florida Police Chiefs' Association.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- The top dogs ruled the world's most famous hot dog eating contest, once again. Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest is always a big event, drawing thousands to Brooklyn's Coney Island to cheer on some of the world's most accomplished competitive eaters. But this year's edition proved extra special for historical, dramatic and sentimental reasons. Making history was Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut. The San Jose, California, resident was no stranger to the Coney Island contest before he won his seventh hot dog-eating title Thursday. That's cumulative and consecutive, as he's won each of these events since 2007. But it's how he did it this time -- topping his own record by gobbling 69 frankfurters and buns in 10 minutes -- that proved one for the record books. His 69 downed dogs is the most by anyone since the competition began in 1916, and one ahead of the 68 mark he'd set last July 4 as well as in 2009. \"Sixty-nine is the magic number,\" Chestnut told ESPN, which broadcast the event. \"Came out here, the crowd pushed me, they would not let me slow down. And it's awesome\" While there was no doubt Chestnut would win after he pulled away to top his nearest foe by 19 hot dogs, the same couldn't be said for the women's event. Every bite counted as Sonya \"The Black Widow\" Thomas and Juliet Lee dueled down to the wire. When the clock ran out, the scoreboard had it as a tie -- 36 hot dogs apiece. But the judges tipped the scales in Thomas' favor, ruling that the Alexandria, Virginia, resident had gorged on 36ยพ hot dogs. That was ยพ more than Lee, enough to give Thomas her third title despite the fact her final tally was far below the 45 hot dogs she put away last Independence Day. Still, Thomas and Chestnut's championships were significant as much for where they took place, as for what they did. Parts of Coney Island, on Brooklyn's southern coast some 12 miles south of Lower Manhattan, were ravaged eight months ago when Superstorm Sandy rolled through. Scores of businesses and backdrops that tens of thousands associate with summer fun suffered major damage there and in other places, like the Jersey Shore. Yet the hum of amusement park rides and the buzz of the throngs packing to cheer on Chestnut, Thomas and others on Thursday is proof that, for one day at least, Coney Island is back.",

It also treats Palestinian patients brought in from Gaza, although none were there when CNN visited. The hospital has been a frequent victim of rocket attacks. Sirens went off as Dr. Chezy Levy, the hospital's general manager, spoke. To prepare for more casualties, the hospital has brought in more surgeons and cleared its operating schedule, he said. It has 12 surgical rooms, including five in reinforced shelters. Levy said soldiers have been brought in with shrapnel wounds, gunshot wounds -- often to legs and arms -- and also other injuries consistent with a war zone. \"Since the campaign started with the infantry troops, we got a lot of casualties among the soldiers and we treated them here,\" he said. In total, 425 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It's unknown how many were militants. The United Nations has estimated that 70% were civilians. Eighteen Israeli soldiers have been killed, in addition to two civilians.

        "input": "(CNN) -- Keeping Sumatran tigers, orangutans and elephants in captivity is not an ideal situation. These animals should be in the wild. The problem is, their habitat is dwindling to such a low level, and it's often safer for the animals to live in captivity. The habitat for critically endangered Sumatran tigers has dwindled so much and poaching is such a large threat that there are more Sumatran tigers in captivity than live in the wild. As the number of tigers decrease, the captive tigers are the species' only hope for survival. There are those animals living in captivity that can't be released back into the wild. These are animals with diseases or defects like tigers that were rescued from poacher's snares. Many of these tigers are missing paws and parts of their legs. In the wild, they would have difficulty finding food and escaping danger. In this case, the tigers are put in zoos or sanctuaries like Taman Safari Indonesia featured in Expedition: Sumatra. Read more: The battle to save Sumatra's elephants . Animals in sanctuaries like this can serve an important purpose. They are ambassadors of their kind, educators of sorts for people to learn about them. The more people know about these animals and hear about the problems these animals face in the wild, the less likely they will want to kill them or destroy their habitat. The animals also inspire fundraising for the important work conservationist groups are doing to preserve these species. Captive animals also have another important role. In the wild, as populations decline, animals start to mate with their close relatives creating problems associated with inbreeding. When sanctuaries and zoos breed these animals, they make sure to do it with the genetic diversity of the species in mind. It is all a proactive approach that could prevent the extinction of the species. Read more: The final days of the Sumatran tiger? It's the sad truth that humans are causing and trying to the problem of animal population loss. Some of us are turning the rainforest into giant palm oil plantations and some of us are working to save that rainforest. Some of us are killing the tigers to sell their skins and some of us are taking care of disabled baby tigers in captivity to make sure the species doesn't go extinct. We humans are at war with ourselves and it's a war the endangered Sumatran wildlife is slowing losing. Without some kind of action to stop poaching and habitat loss, the critically endangered Sumatran elephants, orangutans and tigers will slowly and quietly decline. These once majestic species will only be seen behind a barrier at a zoo. Eventually, the species will go extinct. That's what conservationists at sanctuaries and zoos as well as non-profit groups like WWF are pushing so hard to stop. Education through the animal ambassadors in captivity is one way to help reverse the trend and hopefully save the species from irradiation.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- U.S. Sen. Jon Tester is famous for his flat-top and middle of the road politics. Amanda Curtis, Tester's fellow Democrat and would-be colleague from Montana, is known for her nose ring and her unabashedly liberal affiliations. Although many insiders dismiss her campaign as a long shot, Amanda Curtis is raising money at a prodigious rate and battling assertions that she is too radical for conservative-leaning Montana. But on many issues, the candidate admits she needs to study up. But time is running out with Election Day a little more than two months away. Curtis, a Butte math teacher serving her first-term in the Montana state house, has already raised $180,000 in 10 days, according to her campaign, and sees \"people coming out of the woodwork\" to support her. According to Curtis, who spoke with CNN last week, her nomination as the Democratic Senate candidate \"came from incredible circumstance.\" Curtis added that she had not even planned to seek re-election to her seat in the state legislature, let alone run for the U.S. Senate. An untested candidate . But that \"incredible circumstance\" comes with a price for Curtis and the Democrats who thrust an untested candidate into the national spotlight overnight. When asked her position on the situation in Iraq, Curtis told CNN, \"Give me a little more time.\" On the border crisis, \"I'll need more time, you know only 11 days ago I was painting my storm windows.\" One area the teacher had a firm answer was Common Core, the controversial national education standards opposed by teachers' unions but supported by the Obama administration. Curtis said, \"I am excited by Common Core, as a teacher ... but there has been a rush to implement it and that's the problem.\" Montana State University professor David Parker concedes that \"she's clearly rough. ... It's going to take time to get her answers down to sound bite quality.\" Not going to back down . But Robyn Driscoll, a Democratic Montana state senator, finds the lack of polish \"a refreshing change from the usual spin. ... Her approach tells voters she is not going to back down.\" Her priorities: access to public lands, opposition to Rep. Paul Ryan's House GOP budget, and \"economic policies for the 100%, not the 1%.\" Curtis, 34, has already garnered the support of the state's unions, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean's Democracy for America and Tester, the state's two-term Democratic senator. \"As Montana's senior senator, I'll be supporting Amanda as well as all Democrats who are talking about the issues that are important to Montana,\" Tester told CNN. \"Amanda's energy and enthusiasm will be a refreshing change and will bring attention to issues facing working families like education and access to our public lands.\" Tester helping out . Tester's spokeswoman Marnee Banks confirmed that he has been helping Curtis fundraise and plans to continue to make calls on her behalf. When Tester's counterpart, Max Baucus, left the Senate this year for the U.S. ambassador's post in Beijing, Montana Democrats were in a pickle. They needed a replacement. They chose John Walsh, a decorated veteran, the head of the state's National Guard and its lieutenant governor, to keep the seat blue. It was already an uphill battle in the Big Sky state against popular freshman U.S. Rep. Steve Daines, the Republican nominee. Then the plagiarism charges hit after a New York Times story detailed how Walsh lifted large parts of his master's thesis from others' work. Walsh dropped his campaign within two weeks, vowing to stay in the Senate. Little time to vet candidate . Rushing to fill the seat, they chose Curtis at a nominating convention with little time to vet her for the job. After the nomination was announced, the state Republican Party circulated a montage of Curtis's Youtube videos that catalogue her first term as a state representative. In the video, Curtis is critical of gun-rights supporters, calls herself \"an anarchist at heart,\" and explains she had to restrain herself from punching a fellow state representative who expressed anti-gay sentiments. Chairwoman of the Young Democrats of Montana Marissa Perry said the GOP is taking the remarks out of context in an attempt to smear Curtis. \"I encourage you to watch the whole thing. They are not showing the full story,\" Perry told CNN. Curtis, for her part, stands by the videos she contends are being manipulated, and encouraged voters to watch them in their entirety. \"Those videos are my public record,\" Curtis said. Conservative criticism . Conservative critics have unearthed other controversial statements and affiliations, including Curtis' association with the Industrial Workers of the World. IWW is a far left union movement that hopes to \"take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth,\" according to its website. Her husband, Kevin, is listed as a local organizer for IWW in Montana. Phil Kerpen of the conservative advocacy group American Commitment, which first published Curtis' affiliation with IWW, told CNN, \"Plagiarism disqualified a Senate candidate, but extremist ideology, advocacy of violence, and membership in the Industrial Workers of the World results in nothing but praise for his replacement. This is what the Democratic Party has become in 2014.\" Curtis campaign manager Clayton Elliot was asked about the union affiliation and criticism, but replied by emphasizing her populist approach. \"Amanda grew up in a family that struggled to put food on the table so she knows first hand the struggles of Montana working families. Unlike Congressman Daines, Amanda believes that we must put working Montana families ahead of corporate special interests,\" Elliot said. Dems see her as a net-plus . Democratic strategists see Curtis's firebrand politics as a net-plus, if not for her race, for down ballot races. They confided that before her entry into the race, liberal voters were unlikely to turn out for the Democratic ticket in an off-year. The Curtis run will change that, they told CNN. The Senate Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, is widely expected to lay low and not invest in the Curtis campaign, which is down double digits in the latest polling. Professor Parker thinks it increasingly unlikely Curtis will receive significant outside support \"unless she closes in on Daines in the polls and money race.\" For their part, the National Republican Senate Committee is confident that Curtis won't be able to breakthrough against Daines, who has a huge advantage in name recognition and fundraising. \"Our strategy will remain internal, but it seems telling that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is telling allies that they've given up on the race entirely,\" said NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen. But Curtis backers remain upbeat. Driscoll said the GOP \"should take (Amanda) seriously\" since she raised $150,000 in the first week of her campaign \"just using social media!\" Calls by CNN to the DSCC seeking comment were not immediately returned.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Few dinosaurs have as interesting a back story as the spinosaurus. In life, it dominated the waterways -- a 50-foot-long behemoth that employed its blade-like claws and conical, razor-sharp teeth to annihilate its prey. It chomped down on sharks for breakfast. Ninety-five million years after its extinction, this strangely aquatic dinosaur -- the only one of its kind that we know of -- has had to contend with Nazis, bomb raids, armed gangs and mysterious moustachioed men. Its story has all the makings of a spy novel. The most recent chapter in the spinosaurus' long and very bizarre tale occurred last year when Nizar Ibrahim, a German-Moroccan palaeontologist from the University of Chicago, uncovered the most complete skeleton fossil of the species yet found in Morocco's Sahara Desert. It also happens to be the only remaining skeleton of the species, as all other physical evidence of the spinosaurus was obliterated 70 years ago. \"It's a really mysterious dinosaur. (Until now), all we had was little bits and pieces, tantalizing clues and drawings of a partial skeleton that had been destroyed in World War II,\" explains Ibrahim. Early bones . The first, and up until recently only, spinosaurus skeleton ever found was uncovered by a fossil collector working for German palaeontologist Ernst Stromer -- then one of the world's leading experts on the enigmatic dinosaurs of North Africa. For years, Stromer unearthed a paleontological treasure trove in the Sahara. \"Ernst Stromer was really a very productive scientist. He was an explorer, and he was really the first person to resurrect the lost world of Africa's dinosaurs in a big way,\" says Ibrahim. Unfortunately, his luck turned with the onset of a war that would rob him of his sons -- two died in battle while the third barely survived a five-year imprisonment -- and his life's work. Most of his finds were stored at a palaeontology museum in Munich. He begged the director to relocate the dinosaur collection, but was refused, and in April 1944, an allied air raid destroyed the institution and Stromer's findings. \"Everything went up in flames, and Stromer lost all these incredible finds in a single night,\" recalls Ibrahim, who considers Stromer his role model. \"Resurrecting the spinosaurus -- his most famous discovery -- was the best way to bring Stromer back into the books of dinosaur palaeontology,\" he says. The man with the mustache . Ibrahim's hunt for the spinosaurus began in 2008 when he met a moustachioed Moroccan fossil hunter who was proffering rare-looking samples from a cardboard box. \"One piece looked really interesting. It was a blade-shaped piece of bone and I did think at the time that maybe this is a chunk of the spine of spinosaurus,\" he recalls. Years later, colleagues from the Natural History Museum in Milan showed him similar samples of what they, too, believed was a partial skeleton of a spinosaurus. \"It was spectacular. We had leg bones and spines and ribs and skull bones. It was very exciting, but we had a big problem. We had no idea where the skeleton came from, (which) means we don't know anything about the environment the animal lived in, the geological context, or if the bones were found in the same place,\" he says. With a closer look, however, the bones looked familiar. Ibrahim suspected they not only came from the same site as the specimen he was shown in Morocco, but from the same dinosaur. What followed was a five-year hunt for the man with the mustache -- it was the only detail Ibrahim remembered about the encounter. In 2013, Ibrahim called off the search while sipping mint tea with colleagues in a Moroccan cafe. \"I think I was a little naive and very optimistic, and ... we thought, OK, we can't find the guy, so that's the end of our mission impossible. Just like in a bad Hollywood movie, the very moment when I was ready to throw in the towel, a man walked passed our table. The man had a mustache and it was the man I had been looking for.\" After Ibrahim caught up with him, the man took him back to where he first made the finds. Further excavations dug up even more bones, most likely from the same animal. The collection painted the most complete picture to date of what the animal looked like and how it lived. Mainly, Ibrahim was able to ascertain that spinosaurus was an aquatic dinosaur (a first; previously, there was no known evidence of such a creature). Dense bones -- rare in dinosaurs but common in penguins -- provided the animal with buoyancy in rivers, while a crocodile-like snout helped it both to breathe and sense movement underwater. A seven-foot \"sail\" on the animal's back helped it navigate through the seas. The findings were published in the journal Science last month, are the cover story of this month's issue of National Geographic, and are also currently the subject of an exhibit at the National Geographic Museum in Washington. The Sahara: Land of giants . The Sahara of today can be pretty inhospitable. The land is vast and remote, and offers few visual clues. Temperatures rarely dip below 100 F, and high winds make for some ferocious sandstorms. The sand is also riddled with booby traps: Scorpions, snakes and landmines -- not to mention the odd armed militia doing the rounds -- which tend to keep most palaeontologists at bay. Ibrahim, however, is addicted to the landscape. \"The Sahara is a magical place. You'll find fossils of giant fish and river turtles and crocodile-like predators, and that's when it hits you: This place was very, very different 95 million years ago. It was a bizarre world, really like a different planet,\" he says. In place of the current, seemingly endless expanse of sand, there was a river system that housed all manner of strange creatures. \"I call it 'the river of giants.' (There were) giant sawfish and lungfish, flying reptiles -- some with wingspans of six or seven meters -- and lots of predatory dinosaurs.\" It's a place Ibrahim is eager to revisit. \"Let's just say this isn't the last time I travel to the Sahara in search of lost worlds and bizarre creatures,\" he says.",

        "input": "Editor's note: Angelo Falcón, a political scientist, is president of the National Institute for Latino Policy, a nonprofit think tank on issues affecting the Latino community. He is co-editor of \"Boricuas in Gotham: Puerto Ricans in the Making of Modern New York,\" and author of the \"Atlas of Stateside Puerto Ricans.\" Angelo Falcón says Sonia Sotomayor's identification as a Puerto Rican has caused her joy and a little grief. NEW YORK (CNN) -- The nomination of Sonia Sotomayor for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States has raised the profile of Puerto Ricans in the American consciousness. Her identification as a Puerto Rican has caused Judge Sotomayor both joy and a little grief during this stormy nomination process. But, being a Puerto Rican who also grew up in New York City, well, I can say that's par for the course for most of us. Despite Puerto Rico being a possession of the United States since 1898, most Americans know very little about the island and Puerto Ricans -- except for tourism commercials. Many consider Puerto Ricans living in the United States outside of Puerto Rico (I called these \"Stateside Puerto Ricans\") another new immigrant group of Latinos. But the reality is that we can trace Puerto Rican settlements in New Orleans to the 1860s and workers from Puerto Rico migrated to Hawaii around 1900. In 1917, through an act of the United States Congress (the Jones Act), the people of Puerto Rico were made United States citizens, enabling them to come to the United States freely and legally without passport or visa. I grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York, in an area known as \"Los Sures\" (The Southside). Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1951, my mother brought me to New York when I was only 6 months old. Now, to point out how different we are from most Americans, check this out: Despite living 99 percent of my life in New York and being a U.S. citizen for 100 percent of my life, under some interpretations of the law, because I was not born in a state of the United States (nor were my parents), I may not even be eligible to run for president of the United States! I am not sure how this has affected my career development, but I am sure it has resulted in some deep psychological trauma that I have yet to understand. Puerto Ricans have been migrating to the United  States since the 1800s, but it wasn't until World War II that this population movement peaked. At the time of this \"Great Migration\" over 80 percent of the Puerto Rican population in the United States lived in New York City. \"West Side Story,\" \"The Blackboard Jungle,\" Piri Thomas' book, \"Down These Mean Streets,\" all tried to capture this experience. It was a time when we became social guinea pigs, the subjects of Oscar Lewis' \"culture of poverty\" experiments and the like. Fast forward to today: The 800,000 Puerto Ricans in New York City represent about 20 percent of the more than 4 million Puerto Ricans living stateside. There are now more Puerto Ricans living stateside than in Puerto Rico. The fastest-growing Puerto Rican settlements in the States are in Florida and the South, not in the Northeast and Midwest where Puerto Ricans traditionally migrated. While once seen as basically a very poor community, the stateside Puerto Rican community has become more economically, politically and culturally complex than ever. Alongside very poor Puerto Ricans in areas such as the South Bronx, there are growing middle-class Puerto Rican neighborhoods in the New York suburbs. Settlements in states such as Florida, Texas and California are full of Puerto Rican professionals --- surgeons, engineers, lawyers. Where once this was seen as a very politically liberal community captured by the Democratic Party, in these newer settlements we are seeing a growing trend toward conservative politics. Then there is Puerto Rico. There are about 4 million residents, 95 percent of whom identify as Puerto Rican. Puerto Rico is a territorial possession of the United States, which was formally defined a commonwealth after a vote by its residents in 1952. The U.S. Congress is currently debating its future political status -- whether it should remain a commonwealth, or become a state or an independent nation. And it appears Puerto Ricans living stateside are as divided on this question as those in Puerto Rico. The U.S. Supreme Court once described Puerto Rico's relationship to the United States as \"foreign in a domestic sense.\" Don't worry, I don't know what that means either. But it does point to a rather convoluted relationship embodied in a series of Supreme Court decisions called the Insular Cases. The bottom line is Puerto Rico is an integral part of the United States. They use the same currency, follow the same laws and are subject to the same federal courts system. They even have the same fast food places -- so they are killing themselves dietarily just like the rest of the United States. However, did you know that despite being U.S. citizens, the people of Puerto Rico can't vote for the U.S. president? And Puerto Rico is excluded when the U.S. Census Bureau reports its numbers on Hispanic population in the United States? So, next time you hear a report on U.S. Hispanic population, add 4 million to get it right! As Judge Sotomayor's Puerto Rican heritage is discussed in reference to her nomination, it is clear that it is an experience that is thoroughly American. Exotic as we may sound to some, we are a people just trying to get by and as bewildered by American politics and jusiprudence as the next guy. Judge Sotomayor, as a Puerto Rican, is, well, as American as mango pie. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Angelo Falcón.",

The State Department is leading an inter-agency effort to support American companies in their efforts to secure commercial opportunities in Iraq. With one of the largest customer bases in the Arab world, along with one of the best-educated work forces in the region, Clinton said, Iraq poses significant opportunities for American companies. The International Monetary Fund has projected for Iraq to grow faster than China over the next two years, she said. The United States, through its embassy and consulates throughout the country, stands ready to assist American companies \"to help create the conditions for investment and growth that will be broadly spread and create a ladder of economic opportunity for those willing to work hard,\" Clinton said. \"Iraqis are looking to rebuild every sector of their economy, not only their oil sector but agribusiness, transportation, housing, banking and many others.\" With additional help from the Departments of Treasury, Energy and Agriculture, among others, the United States will actively support efforts of American businesses to set up operations to compete with Turkish, Chinese, French, Jordanian and Iranian companies already seeking business opportunities in Iraq. James Jeffrey, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, is also working to establish an American Chamber of Commerce in Iraq to serve as an advocate for American businesses. Despite the opportunity Iraq offers, Clinton said, she would \"not sugarcoat\" the difficulties posed by the current working environment in Iraq. \"There are still significant security challenges, bottlenecks in infrastructure, unclear regulations and, unfortunately, corruption. But as our Iraqi colleagues will tell you, they are working hard to make it easier to do business in Iraq for Iraqis and foreign investors alike.\" Clinton said the United States would also make it a priority to support the integration of women into the Iraqi work force. \"I know that a lot of the best students in Iraqi universities happen to be women, and I hope that Iraq takes full advantage of half the population, ready to work, ready to roll up their sleeves to assist in the transformation of their country,\" she said.

        "input": "(CNN) -- Russia still has about 1,000 troops inside eastern Ukraine, a NATO military officer said Thursday, a week after Ukraine's government and pro-Russian rebels agreed to a ceasefire aimed at ending months of conflict. NATO also sees 20,000 more Russian troops aligned along the border, the NATO officer told CNN. He was not named according to standard practice in the organization. NATO believes that these numbers amount to a large and effective military force, the officer said. In addition to the troop numbers, NATO continues to see sophisticated Russian military equipment in Ukraine. NATO remains concerned and urges Russia to engage with the international community and Ukraine to find a political solution to the crisis, the officer said. Moscow has consistently denied allegations by Kiev and the West that Russia has troops in Ukraine, and that it has armed and supported the rebels. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said some 70% of the Russian troops believed to have been in Ukraine had withdrawn back across the border, according to the national news agency Ukrinform. Information released by Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council on Thursday indicated that the rebel forces control a strip of eastern Ukraine running from the city of Luhansk down to the Sea of Azov. 'Very fragile' ceasefire . The truce was signed Friday after talks in Minsk, Belarus, between representatives of Ukraine, the rebels and Russia. But more substantive talks on issues, including the decentralization of power and constitutional reform in Ukraine, must still take place before a lasting resolution can be found. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich told a briefing Thursday that the ceasefire was \"very fragile\" and that both sides must implement the framework agreed to in Minsk. \"There is mounting evidence of the Kiev government strengthening its military groups in different areas, regions; there are eyewitness reports to prove it,\" he said, \"though Ukrainian authorities keep on reassuring us that they're not planning a military operation.\" Lukashevich said Russia was also surprised by NATO's announcement of plans to hold joint military exercises with Kiev in Ukraine later this year. \"This might cause the escalation (of the situation) and put the progress in peaceful settlement of the crisis in Ukraine under threat,\" he warned. New sanctions . A new round of European Union sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine will come into force Friday, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said Thursday. EU officials will review the implementation of the ceasefire before the end of the month, he said, after which the sanctions could be amended or lifted. The sanctions include tougher restrictions on Russia's access to EU capital markets; a ban on loans by EU companies or individuals to five major Russian state-owned banks; a ban on debt financing to three major Russian defense companies and three major energy companies; and an asset freeze and travel ban against 24 more individuals. This means 119 people in total are now subject to sanctions, while 23 entities remain under an asset freeze in the European Union. Russia has warned it will respond to any additional measures. In his remarks, Lukashevich said the deadly crash in July of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 -- which Kiev and the West believe was shot down from rebel-held territory using a Russian-made missile launcher -- was being used to justify the imposition of broad Western sanctions against Russia. A preliminary report into the crash released this week by Dutch investigators did not apportion blame for the crash but said the plane was brought down by \"high-energy objects\" from outside. The United States will join the European Union in implementing additional sanctions against Russia over its \"illegal actions in Ukraine,\" President Obama said Thursday. \"We will deepen and broaden sanctions in Russia's financial, energy, and defense sectors,\" he said. The administration will outline the specifics of the sanctions Friday. \"We are implementing these new measures in light of Russia's actions to further destabilize Ukraine over the last month, including through the presence of heavily armed Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. We are watching closely developments since the announcement of the ceasefire and agreement in Minsk, but we have yet to see conclusive evidence that Russia has ceased its efforts to destabilize Ukraine,\" Obama said. Aid convoy . Lukashevich also said there had not yet been a \"breakthrough\" allowing a new Russian aid convoy to start moving into Ukraine in the next few days. \"We hope that the delivery will be carried out with participation of Ukraine's border guards and customs officers as well as officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross,\" he said. \"We hope, however, that the coordination would not be dragged out.\" A previous convoy carrying aid for civilians caught up in the fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions was sent over the border by Russia without permission from Ukrainian authorities. The Presidents of Russia and Ukraine are \"broadly satisfied\" with the status of the ceasefire, Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told Russia's Interfax news agency on Wednesday. CNN's Andrew Carey in Kiev and Alla Eshchenko in Moscow contributed to this report. CNN's James Frater also contributed.",

He could feel the lump in his throat as he warned her: You have three minutes to get to a safe place. The twister was hurtling straight toward her. It was one of two apparent tornadoes that ripped through the area Friday. Scott jumped in his car and furiously drove the three miles from his home to the school. The speedometer said 80. In his read view mirror, he could see four police cars. But they weren't chasing him. They were also charging towards to the school and the sitting targets within. Scott arrived to a surreal scene wrought by the fury of the storm. His heart skipped a few beats. He was one of thousands of Americans unnerved Friday by a swath of severe weather that extended from Alabama to Indiana. Inside the school, it was hot, damp and dark -- the power was out. The staff had gone into storm mode at about 8:45 in the morning, huddling the students in the safest place of all, the hallway, Scott said. Rose was huddled with her classmates. She could feel her frightened friend's clawing into her arm. Everyone knew the tornado coming their way, like a killer approaching a helpless victim. Everyone was terrified. Rose was 20 feet away from the door and could feel the wind forcing its way underneath. It was so strong that even through the cracks, it made her hair fly. \"We didn't know if it was going to bust open at any minute,\" she said. Signs outside were blowing; trees bending. Suddenly, it became sunny. The wind went one way one minute and another, the next. Then, it began raining. Hard. The pressure changed and got so bad it made Rose's ears hurt. She got low to the floor. A large trash bin flew through the air. Where once there had been tall oaks, there was nothing. They were horizontal with the earth and Rose could see the house that used to be hidden by vegetation across the street. When it was over, teachers screamed as they saw their wrecked cars, the building's windows shattered and part of the roof in the parking lot. Similar storms ripped through the Huntsville area about a year ago. Students, teachers and parents all had their memories. Rose had even chased tornadoes with her dad -- both father and daughter are fascinated with science and meteorology. But she had never lived through a tornado before. Now she knew what it felt like. \"It was a whole different experience,\" she said. \"I couldn't even text. My hands were shaking so bad.\" Many of the students were trying to call their moms and dads but cell phone service was sketchy. She was relieved to see her father when he arrived at the school. Scott said his daughter's friends pleaded with him. \"Please, Mr. Scott,\" they said. \"Take us home.\" But he couldn't. School policy forbade it so that all the students could be accounted for. \"It was heartbreaking,\" he said. \"It was horrible in there. They were so scared and apprehensive.\" Scott felt incredibly lucky that everyone he loved was alright. He took his daughter home and passed the rest of the day under a tornado watch.",

        "input": "Mecca, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- Chanting \"Allahu Akbar\" -- God is Greater than any -- more than 2 million pilgrims crossed new pedestrian bridges Saturday to perform one of the last rituals of the Hajj season. Jamarat is a re-enactment of an event when Prophet Abraham stoned the devil and rejected his temptations, according to Muslim traditions. The ritual stoning of three pillars, which occurs in the tent city of Mina -- about two miles from Mecca, was the scene of stampedes and many deaths in the 1980s and 1990s as pilgrims passed a crowded bottleneck area leading to the small pillars on the ground. But this year the Saudi government completed a new project that avoids past congestion at the site. The government has erected three massive pillars and completed a $1.2 billion, five-story bridge nearby where pilgrims can toss stones. Authorities and pilgrims say it's a roomier atmosphere and more efficient way to accommodate the faithful. \"Everything went fine so far,\" Col. Khakled Qarar Mohammadi, head of the emergency forces at Jamarat, told CNN. \"It is an immense responsibility that we had to deal with. About 3 million pilgrims move in a small geographic area at the same time wanting to do the same ritual. So we have been preparing for this for years now.\" Irtiza Hasan, a pilgrim from the United States, said all went well at the ceremony. \"The only incident I saw was that there were some handicapped women who were turned away in fears that they get hurt.\" But Mohammadi said, \"There are 10 vans on the second floor especially designated to serve the elderly and handicapped. Each van can take up to 14 pilgrims.\" As a measure to alleviate harm, according to Muslim traditions, the elderly and the handicapped can appoint someone else to stone for them. The five-story Jamarat bridge is air-conditioned at 19 degrees Centigrade, or 66 Fahrenheit, throughout the day and backed by water sprinklers that can reduce the temperature to about 29 degrees C, or 84 F. The bridge is designed to allow the addition of seven more levels to hold as many as 5 million pilgrims in the future if the need arises. According to authorities, the bridge is 950 meters (1,039 yards) long and 80 meters (87 yards) wide. Each floor is 12 meters (13 yards) high with three tunnels and 12 entrances and 12 exits in six directions. It has a helicopter pad for emergencies. According to Mohammadi, the project has 509 advanced closed-circuit television cameras monitoring pilgrims' movements. Those cameras feed into the main operations room, which oversees the Jamarat Bridge and the surrounding areas -- all screened by dozens of security officers on 72 monitors at the operation room. The stoning ritual is done over at least two days, where pilgrims stone three pillars at Mina -- believed to be where the Prophet Abraham stoned the devil when he tried to dissuade him from obeying God's orders to slaughter his son. According to tradition, the event was a test from God, who gave Abraham a ram to slaughter instead. The last ritual that marks the end of Hajj is when pilgrims go from Mina to Mecca to make a last visit to al-Masjid al-Haram, Islam's holiest site, before going back home. The ritual is called Tawaf al-Wada'a -- or farewell circumambulation in the holy mosque. It's where pilgrims go around the black cube seven times counter-clockwise asking that their Lord accept their pilgrimage and grant them another visit to the holy city.",

And for a while he even considered keeping the snacks in his hand throughout the interview. \"I want to just hold a bowl of nuts the entire time and not really explain it.\" However, in the end he placed it back on the table, with a simple, \"That's dumb.\" And, thus, we launched into a spirited conversation about what a huge dork he is. Because, apparently, when you're the son of a professional bowler (for real) you naturally develop a passion for the uncool. Sometimes that passion leads to a lonely, sexless life spent in your parents' basement, but, in this case, it manifested itself in the form of one of the biggest names in nerddom. \"I just kind of one day was like, 'Why am I not working around this kind of thing?' And it just so happened that G4 existed and it all fell together.\" Soon he was hosting a new show called \"Web Soup,\" modeled after E!'s show \"The Soup.\" Whereas the latter concentrates on pop culture and notable television moments, Hardwick's new endeavor became a showcase for the best (and worst) of the Web. However, \"Web Soup\" perhaps wasn't quite nerdy enough, so in 2010 Hardwick continued doing the show while also launching a new weekly interview podcast called \"The Nerdist.\" Jim Norton: I'm dangerous to other comedians . That venture eventually led to him writing a book called \"The Nerdist Way,\" in which Hardwick offers self-help advice to his people. The book is due out this fall -- so hopefully none of his nerd followers will create an evil world-destroying robot in the meantime. That would be just tragic. Funny. But tragic.

The 32-year-old was able to ride at the Melbourne Cup only because Dunaden's usual mount Craig Williams was serving a ban for careless riding, and he had never seen the famed Flemington raceway before Monday. Flown in by the French-trained stayer's owner Sheikh Fahad Al-Thani, Lemaire triumphed by the narrowest of margins after a photo-finish with Britain's Red Cadeaux in the 151st running of the prestigious event. \"I was a bit anxious after the line,\" Lemaire told reporters after claiming the $6.4 million first prize for the Qatari. \"A rider on a pony told me they thought I had won and then when I turned the corner back towards the stands, everyone was applauding me. \"I wasn't supposed to ride him and didn't know until yesterday. Craig must be devastated and I hope he recovers quickly and that he will win many more big races. \"Two years ago I had a fall before Arc weekend and I missed winning four Group One races so I know what it is like to watch in your armchair.

Williams rode Dunaden to victory at the Geelong Cup warm-up as trainer Mikel Delzangles followed the example set by last year's winner Americain, who could only manage fourth on Tuesday behind German-bred Lucas Cranach. \"It's amazing. I thought I was beaten so it's even better,\" Delzangles said. \"We knew he was a good stayer, but I thought the race was so difficult to win. \"Maybe thanks to Americain last year, it made us realize that it was possible to do it. We were just beaten in a Group Two at Longchamp (in May), then we decided that we should look at the Melbourne Cup. \"I would like to have a thought for Craig Williams.

In a 2011 survey of 150,000 adults in 148 countries, it found that more than 75% of adults earning less than $2 per day are \"unbanked\" or do not use a formal financial institution. Of 70,000 respondents without a bank account, 65% cited not having enough money to use one as the most important reason. Other top reasons included the cost of opening a bank account being too expensive and a lack of trust in banks. \"I hope policy makers will use this research to help make sure everyone, everywhere, has access to financial services,\" Her Royal Highness Princess MÃ¡xima of the Netherlands and the UN Secretary General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development said in a news release. Among regions surveyed, people in the Middle East and North Africa have most difficulties, with only 18% reporting an account. In high-income economies, nine out of 10 adults have an account at a formal financial institution. Being 'unbanked' is linked to inequalities, according to The World Bank. The richest 20% of adults in developing countries are more than twice as likely to have an account as the poorest 20%. Also, in developing economies only 37% of women have a bank account compared with 46% of men keeping their savings in financial institutions. A bank account could enhance economic opportunities among the poor, as saving and borrowing enables them to start a business or invest in education. Instead, they often rely on money lenders charging high fees, the World Bank says. \"Providing financial services to the 2.5 billion people who are 'unbanked' could boost economic growth and opportunity for the world's poor,\" says World Bank Group President Robert B. Zoellick. Mobile banking is becoming a popular alternative to money lenders among the poor, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. These money transfers through mobile phones enable them to pay bills or make deposits through a text message without traveling or setting up a formal bank account. Mobile banking is especially popular in Kenya, where about 7 in 10 adults have access to mobile money services, according to Safaricom, a leading mobile network provider that offers money transfers via text messaging through its M-Pesa service.

A doctor who's nearing retirement suddenly blanks on a longtime patient's name. So-called senior moments like these aren't unusual as people age, but if memory lapses on the job persist, get worse, and can no longer be overlooked or downplayed by colleagues, it could be a red flag for Alzheimer's disease. \"New cases of Alzheimer's occur every 70 seconds,\" says Richard Mayeux, MD, a professor of neurology, psychiatry, and epidemiology at Columbia University, in New York City. \"The total number of individuals with problems like this will increase as the population ages.\" Health.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . Given the aging population and the weak economy -- which is prompting older people who do have jobs to stay in them -- the problem will likely only get worse. More than 5 million people in the U.S. have Alzheimer's disease, and this number will quadruple by 2050, according to the Alzheimer's Association. In a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in May, 35% of employed adults over the age of 61 said they'd delayed their retirement due to the recession. Roughly 60% of people in their 50s were worried they would have to do the same. Spotting the warning signs of Alzheimer's . What does early Alzheimer's look like on the job? The warning signs may differ depending on the profession, but one common denominator that affects executives, doctors, and construction workers alike is an overall decline in job performance, according to John C. Morris, MD, the director of the Alzheimer's disease research center at Washington University, in St. Louis. \"People just can't do their job as well as before,\" Dr. Morris says. \"These changes or declines in mental ability are subtle, so co-workers will cover up at first and make excuses such as 'Well, Fred is getting over the loss of his brother' or 'We just got a new computer system.' Gradually, their level of responsibility has to keep getting reduced so the person is either let go or kept on in a largely ceremonial role.\" Health.com: 9 foods that may help save your memory . This pattern of rationalization and decreased responsibility is \"very common,\" says Patrick Lyden, MD, the chair of the department of neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in Los Angeles. \"We see it most often in businesses where the founder is still in charge.\" Short-term memory loss is the hallmark early symptom of Alzheimer's. Initially, memory problems may show up as forgetting appointments, repeating anecdotes, confusion, misplacing things, and trouble finding the right word in conversation. \"Eventually the diagnosis is made when the impairment is to the point where no one can ignore it anymore,\" Dr. Lyden says. \"People come to me because the forgetfulness has gone beyond names and phone numbers to include meetings, key decisions, and reiterating and rehashing decisions that have already been made.\" Health.com: How to age-proof your memory . Memory loss isn't the only warning sign, however. Others include difficulty with technology and new tasks, and personality changes such as becoming more withdrawn and less talkative. In some cases, people may become irritable or agitated, or may start to behave inappropriately. These signs often become noticeable in the workplace before anywhere else. \"A lot of time stuff shows up at work that doesn't show up at home,\" says Anna Treinkman, RN, a nurse practitioner at the Rush University Alzheimer's Disease Clinic, in Chicago.

If a person begins to experience persistent memory problems and other signs of Alzheimer's, the first step is an evaluation that may include blood work, an MRI, and tests of mental function, says Dr. Mayeux, who wrote about Alzheimer's symptoms in the workplace in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year. It's important to seek medical attention sooner rather than later, as early diagnosis may improve prognosis, says Nina Silverberg, PhD, assistant director of the Alzheimer's Disease Centers program at the National Institute on Aging, in Bethesda, Md. \"Get evaluated by a medical professional, whether a neurologist, neuropsychologist, or primary-care doctor,\" Silverberg says. \"The belief in the field is that the earlier you catch it, the more effective certain treatments are. The less damage [to] the neurons, the more likely we will be able to preserve what you have for as long as possible.\" Health.com: Alzheimer's disease: Should I take medicines? If early Alzheimer's is diagnosed, starting one or more prescription drugs may help slow the progression of the disease. But the available medications work only for a short period of time and only in some people, Silverberg says. How to handle Alzheimer's at work . If you have a co-worker who you suspect may be showing signs of Alzheimer's, sitting down with the person and expressing your concern in a nonjudgmental fashion can be helpful. \"Say, 'Have you noticed any memory problems? Do you have concerns or has anyone else commented about this?'\" Treinkman suggests. Calling a family member may also be an option. Although a person could become defensive, \"it's in their best interest to get an evaluation while still working, so they don't get fired,\" Treinkman says. Some employees may be eligible for short- or long-term disability, she adds. Health.com: Should you get disability insurance? The Social Security Administration recently approved expedited benefits for people who have been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's, which is defined as dementia occurring before age 65 (when Medicare kicks in). Roughly 10% of Alzheimer's cases are early-onset. Mary Sano, PhD, the director of the Alzheimer's disease research center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City, worries that the legitimate concerns about rising rates of dementia in the workplace could spill over to older workers who are still competent. \"The awareness of a progressive disease with likelihood of further deterioration would impact on the ability to continue in many types of jobs,\" Sano says. \"Raising the retirement age could increase the likely occurrence of the working population being at risk for the disease, but most problematic is the potential stigma that this risk may impose on an older worker.\" Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

        "input": "Lima, Peru (CNN) -- -- A judge has extended the investigation into murder suspect Joran van der Sloot, accused of killing a Peruvian woman, for another week, a spokeswoman for Peru's Interior Ministry said Sunday. Van der Sloot, a Dutch citizen, will remain jailed at the investigations building of Peru's national police where he spent the night, Rut Cardenas said. Cardenas said a judge has given investigators another week to gather information about the killing of the woman last week. Carlos Neyra, an official with the Peruvian National Police criminal investigation division, said van der Sloot, the sole suspect named in the case, has not been formally charged. Neyra added that van der Sloot now has a lawyer. The Netherlands Embassy says it is working with local authorities in the case, but it is not paying for a defense attorney. The Embassy has told Peruvian authorities that it is not comfortable with the way van der Sloot has been presented to the media, Neyra said. The Peruvian interior minister is asking authorities not to talk about the case without his authorization. Van der Sloot arrived Saturday at the Lima police headquarters. Handcuffed and wearing a protective vest, he was escorted through a news conference held by Peruvian authorities as photographers snapped photo after photo. The body of 21-year-old Stephany Flores Ramirez was found Wednesday in a Lima hotel room registered to van der Sloot, who was twice arrested and released in connection with the 2005 disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Peruvian authorities have released a video from May 30 where the suspect is seen entering the hotel at 5:16 a.m. local time accompanied by Flores. Moments later, he is seen entering a hotel room with Flores. More than three hours later, van der Sloot is seen exiting the hotel alone. A hotel worker is also seen in the video speaking to van der Sloot as he is leaving the hotel, Peru Interior Ministry spokesman Carlos Gonzalo said. When investigators questioned the worker, he told them that van der Sloot told him \"don't bother my girl,\" according to Gonzalo. Van der Sloot indicated to the hotel worker that he would be returning to the room, Gonzalo said. Surveillance video from a casino -- also recorded on May 30 -- shows Flores and van der Sloot playing cards at the same table, he said. The woman won about 5,000 soles (about $1,755), though it was not found in the room or the victim's car, Gonzalo said. Flores' body was badly beaten and investigators believe a tennis racquet in the room was used in the killing, Gonzalo said. He said \"they found bloodied clothes with\" van der Sloot and that investigators are testing them, as well as the tennis racquet, for DNA. The hotel workers became suspicious after no one else left the room, and eventually a foul smell came from it, Gonzalo said. It wasn't immediately clear how much time lapsed between the conversation on video and workers noticing the smell. Chilean authorities delivered van der Sloot to their Peruvian counterparts on Friday in the border town of Santa Rosa, where he was greeted by hecklers and dozens of media personnel jostling for position to get a better picture of him. Paperwork showed that van der Sloot entered Chile the same day Flores' body was found, Chilean police told CNN. He was captured in Chile on Thursday and transported to the border to be expelled, said Macarena Lopez, a spokeswoman for Interpol. Holloway was on a high school graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba, where van der Sloot lived with his family, in 2005 when she disappeared. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in connection with the case but released both times. He denied any involvement and has not been charged. Van der Sloot also faces an arrest warrant on charges of extortion and wire fraud in Alabama, U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance said Thursday. The charges are unrelated to the killing of the Peruvian woman and deal with an attempt to sell details about Holloway for $250,000, Vance said. CNN's Mayra Cuevas and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Thousands of demonstrators marched through cities across Europe on Saturday, calling for an immediate end to Israel's attacks on Gaza. A protester swings a club at a police horse Saturday night near London's Israeli Embassy. Up to 20,000 people were gathered outside the Israeli Embassy in London, England, at the peak of protests there, London Metropolitan Police said. A police officer was knocked unconscious Saturday night as the protests turned unruly, the police said. The London crowd dismantled barriers placed in front of the embassy and began pelting officers with sticks, rocks and pieces of the metal barriers, police said. Three people were arrested. Organizers including the Stop the War Coalition and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign expected more than 100,000 people to join the London march to protest Israel's ongoing attacks on Gaza. Celebrities including musician Annie Lennox and Bianca Jagger, musician Mick Jagger's ex-wife, spoke at a rally before the procession, which went from Hyde Park to the Israeli Embassy in Kensington, West London.  Watch demonstrators throw bottles, metal at police » . Lauren Booth, the sister-in-law of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, also spoke at the rally, The Times newspaper reported. During her speech, Booth criticized Blair over his attempts to bring about a resolution to the conflict. \"Tony Blair's only comment regarding the cease-fire has been to say that it can only take place after the tunnels in Gaza are destroyed,\" The Times quoted her as saying. \"What he is suggesting means that after the massacre, people will have no access to food, kerosene and medicines that came through those tunnels. That is not a cease-fire; that is a slow agonizing death,\" she said, according to The Times. Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone issued a statement backing the demonstration. \"Every day, we see appalling pictures of children slaughtered by Israeli bombs, missiles and other sophisticated weapons,\" he said. \"Yet with more than 700 dead and thousands more seriously wounded, the international community is allowing Israel to continue its completely disproportionate onslaught accompanied by an Orwellian litany of lies.\" Meanwhile, the British Press Association reported that similar demonstrations took place in other British cities, including Newcastle and Edinburgh. Thousands took part in a rally through the center of Edinburgh calling for an end to the military campaign. About 300 shoes and red paint were thrown toward the U.S. consulate in the Scottish capital, the PA said. Thousands demonstrated in other European cities, according to local media reports, including Innsbruck, Austria; Paris, France; Milan, Italy; Berlin, Germany; and Oslo, Norway. iReport: Protests in Paris . In Washington, pro-Palestinian activists rallied outside the temporary residence of President-elect Barack Obama on Saturday and called on the incoming leader to stop the violence in Gaza. About 3,000 people carrying signs and chanting \"Free Palestine\" flooded Lafayette Park between the White House and the Hay-Adams Hotel, where the president-elect is living with his family. Carrying a flag and wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh head scarf, Abdel-Kader Elkabil exhorted the president-elect to take action. \"Please, Mr. Obama, do something. We love you. We voted for you,\" he said. \"I'm expecting you to do something. ... You're the only one who can do something.\" Asma Mobin-Uddin drove to Washington with a group of 500 activists from Ohio. She said she voted for Obama because she believed he could \"make a difference.\" \"President Obama, look in the eyes of your kids and look in the eyes of the kids in that region,\" she said at the rally. \"Please, stop the violence, stop the hate, stop the occupation.\" Israelis say their Gaza military operation, which started December 27, is targeting rocket-launching sites, Hamas infrastructure and the movement's leaders in an effort to stop militants from sending rockets into southern Israel. Palestinian medical sources said that more than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the attacks, including 235 children, and about 3,300 people have been wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died since the operation began. CNN's Rachel Streitfeld and Mona Larijani contributed to this report.",

        "input": "Beijing, China (CNN) -- The Chinese public, especially those in the social networking community, are abuzz over the case of a man charged with killing a girl in a hit-and-run: He is the son of a local deputy police chief. Li Qiming, 23, is accused of \"perpetration of traffic accident,\" a charge punishable by three to seven years in prison. During the two-and-a-half hour trial Wednesday in the northern city of Baoding, Li admitted causing the death of Chen Xiaofeng, 20, according to Chinese media reports. It's more than just a tragic traffic accident. \"There is a lot of popular anger about 'guan er dai,' the children of officials who sometimes literally get away with murder,\" says Jeremy Goldkorn, founding editor-in-chief of Danwei, a China media website. He said the online uproar is focused on \"how likely it is that Li Qiming will get away with a light sentence, and whether blood money will secure his freedom.\" Official media have reported that Li was drunk when he ran over two female students on the Hebei University campus, killing Chen and injuring fellow student Zhang Jingjing. Li allegedly tried to speed away from the scene. It was also reported that, when students and campus security guards stopped him, he shouted at the guards, \"My daddy is Li Gang\" -- referring to a local deputy police chief. When indignant Chinese Internet users got wind of the story, they blogged and reposted it widely. Before long, \"My-daddy-is-Li-Gang\" went viral. \"It spread on the Internet -- on blogs, forum websites and the Twitter-like microblog service Weibo,\" recalls Goldkorn, a long-time observer of China's social networking sites. \"The public expressed outrage on the Internet, and the traditional news media and the government reacted to the Internet coverage of the event.\" Despite the government's efforts to contain the fallout, the incident drew widespread criticism among China's estimated 420 million Internet users. \"My daddy is Li Gang\" became one of the top search items on most popular Chinese search engines, a viral catchphrase synonymous to abuse of power. Some composed sarcastic poems and songs. Others parodied the father-son duo in videos posted in cyberspace. The case became a cause célèbre among Internet users who viewed it as an example of official abuse. It also put the spotlight on the growing gap between the rich and the poor. Chen Lin, the victim's 23-year-old brother, complained: \"In society they say everyone is equal, but in every corner there is inequality. How can you live in this country and this society without any worry? I feel like there should be deep reflection on this. This is the reality.\" Beijing resident Yang Ning, a white-collar worker, agrees. \"The case is symbolic,\" he tells me. \"In China it's all about who your father is. Without a good father, you already lose at the starting line. Without a good father, you have to work 10 times harder than those born with good fathers.\" The Chinese authorities have tried to assuage the public ire. Days after the accident, the China Central Television showed Li under police detention, profusely apologizing and expressing remorse. His father Li Gang also appeared in a nationally broadcast TV interview, breaking down and bowing deeply to apologize to the victim's family. \"As for my child's education, as a father I failed,\" he cried. \"I am very sad, very guilty, very ashamed.\" He promised not to shield his son from the law. In November, according to Chinese media reports, Li Gang reached a civil settlement with the victim's families, agreeing to pay 460,000 yuan (US$67,700) in restitution for the Chen family and 92,000 yuan (US$14,000) to Zhang's family. He did not attend Wednesday's court hearing. The victim's brother Chen Lin attended. \"My family and I want justice,\" he was quoted by the Chinese media as saying. The state prosecutor asked for a three-to-seven year prison sentence for Li, according to the Xinhua News Agency, while the defendant's lawyer called for leniency, noting that he has expressed remorse and compensated the victims' families. It is not known how soon the court will render its sentence. Years ago, incidents like this would have been non-events. Victims would have been intimidated and forgotten. Not this time. \"This is another landmark example of the Internet playing a significant role in curbing official abuses,\" says Goldkorn of Danwei. With the Internet and social network sites at the disposal of millions of ordinary citizens, abusive officials and their children are now getting caught in the act more and more often. \"There have been enough similar cases over the last few years that -- according to Chinese media reports -- some government officials have now acquired 'Internet phobia,'\" observes Goldkorn. \"They fear of having their wrongdoings exposed by angry netizens.\" But Beijing resident Yang Ning is enthused: \"I raise my hand and shout: Long live the Internet!\"",

        "input": "(WIRED) -- Jawbone's UP activity-monitoring wristbands have been failing at an alarming rate. Three review units have failed during Gadget Lab testing, numerous complaints of \"bricked\" units riddle Jawbone's user forums, and the clever health and fitness product currently receives just two out of five stars on Amazon.com reviews -- 41 different user reviews were complaining of 23 bricked devices as of press time. Today, Jawbone CEO Hosain Rahman issued a statement on Jawbone's website explaining the cause of the failures, and offered a comprehensive, perhaps unprecedented, refund program for anyone unhappy with his or her purchase. Apparently, problems with circuit board capacitors are to blame for the litany of units that have trouble keeping a charge, exhibit erratic data-recording behavior, or just plain stop working. Rahman's message to customers reports the following: . \"We've found an issue with two specific capacitors in the power system that affects the ability to hold a charge in some of our bands. We're also fixing an issue with syncing related to the band hardware. Typically, these issues surface within the first seven to ten days of use. The glitches are purely performance related and do not pose any safety risk.\" When the wristband works properly, it records all your daytime footsteps, and later provides a visual report of your walking, running or hiking activity via a nifty iOS app interface. You can also set the band to give you \"Activity Reminders\" -- gentle vibrations on your wrist that compel you to get out of your seat and take a few steps. The UP system also offers nighttime sleep monitoring, providing rich visual graphs detailing periods of deep and light sleep. Well, that's how the UP system operates when working. In our experience with three different failed bands, problems ran a frustrating gamut. One band issued random vibrations (even though no reminders were set) and consistently dropped data before failing to keep a charge, and then dying completely. The other two bands simply exhibited syncing failures before bricking for good. In his statement, Rahman says that Jawbone has \"temporarily paused production\" of the bands, and will once again begin taking orders after the hardware's technical issues have been resolved. Jawbone's VP of Product Management and Strategy Travis Bogard told Wired.com, \"We will bring it back as fast as we can.\" Jawbone is also offering a \"no questions asked\" refund program for anyone who's purchased an UP. Starting tomorrow and running through December 31, 2012, consumers who bought their UP bands from authorized retailers will be granted full refunds, and -- here's the big news -- be allowed to keep their bands. Consumers experiencing hardware problems can also continue to receive replacement bands through Jawbone's existing warranty program. In fact, someone can collect a full refund, as well as receive a replacement band as long as the band qualifies under warranty.

        "input": "(CNN) -- The debate over the number of civilian casualties caused by CIA drone strikes in Pakistan is perhaps the most contentious issue in the often fraught U.S.-Pakistan relationship. On one side are US officials who assert that the strikes kill few, if any, Pakistani civilians. In June 2011, President Barack Obama's then-counterterrorism adviser John Brennan claimed improbably during a speech at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies \"there hasn't been a single collateral death because of the exceptional proficiency, precision of the capabilities that we've been able to develop.\" Two months later, U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity told the New York Times that around 50 civilians had been killed in drone strikes in Pakistan since the 9/11 attacks. On the other side of the debate are Pakistani officials such as the country's powerful Interior Minister Rehman Malik, who asserted in 2012 that 80% of the people killed in drone strikes were civilians. Earlier this year, before he stepped down as Interior Minister, Malik told Pakistani reporters that the strikes had killed mostly women and children. Similarly, Maulana Sami ul-Haq, leader of the Pakistani Islamist party Jamiat Ulama-i-Islam (JUI-S), told crowds at a 2011 conference in Lahore that drones kill \"dozens of innocent people daily.\" Now comes a leaked Pakistani government document that helps to shed light on some of the facts surrounding this debate. According to the internal Pakistani report, civilian casualties from drone strikes are much lower than has often been claimed in Pakistan, but they are also much higher than the U.S. government has asserted. The Pakistani government confirmed 10 civilian deaths in CIA drone strikes in 2009, according to the leaked official document obtained this week by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a London-based organization that tracks the strikes. The report also found that from 2006 through October 24, 2009, civilians made up a minority of those killed in drone strikes: 147 civilians in a total death toll of 742, or about 20%. That number is somewhat lower than the estimates of Western nongovernmental organizations that track the strikes. The New America Foundation estimates that up to 207 civilians were killed from 2006 to October 24, 2009, along with up to 198 people who were not identified in reliable media reports to be either civilians or militants. Oddly, the leaked Pakistani report left out four strikes that occurred in 2007. It also missed nine strikes from 2008 and 2009, in which between eight and 10 civilians were reported killed, according to the New America Foundation's tally. The leaked report is a welcome sign that the Pakistani government is making a concerted effort to confirm the identities of those who have been killed in U.S. drone strikes in the country's remote tribal regions that border with Afghanistan. Pakistani authorities have long denounced the strikes, out of concern that civilian deaths caused by drone strikes inflame the local population, bolster militant groups and violate Pakistan's sovereignty. The civilian casualty rate has declined steadily over the life of the CIA drone program as both technology and intelligence-gathering have improved. One civilian -- a 10-year-old boy -- has been confirmed killed so far in 2013, according to reliable media reports. In 2012, five civilians were confirmed killed, representing 2% of the total deaths. As the civilian casualty rate has fallen, Pakistani officials who oppose the drone strikes have turned more frequently to the argument that they violate Pakistan's sovereignty, regardless of whom they kill. Pakistan's new Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, told parliament in June that \"We respect the sovereignty of others and they should respect our sovereignty and independence. This campaign must come to an end.\" As Sharif wrangles with the United States over the future of the drone program, a complete and authoritative official Pakistani tally of civilian deaths caused by drones would be a useful tool for those discussions. The leaked Pakistani report is a step in the right direction.",

The vote was overwhelmingly against Abushagur's plan, with 125 voting \"no confidence,\" 44 \"confidence\" and 17 abstaining. Libyans went to the polls three months ago to elect GNC members -- the nation's first elected body in almost half a century -- with expectations of change and progress that elected officials could bring about.

        "input": "(CNN) -- President Barack Obama blamed the fiscal cliff standoff in Congress for the contraction in the U.S. economy at the end of 2012 and weighed in on the safety of football in a pre-Super Bowl interview Sunday. During the roughly eight-minute live session with CBS host Scott Pelley, Obama said new concerns about long-term brain damage in football players \"means the game is probably going to evolve a little bit.\" \"For those of us who like to see a big hit and enjoy the rock 'em, sock 'em elements of the game, we're probably going to be occasionally frustrated,\" the president said. But he added, \"We want to make sure that after people have played the game, that they're going to be OK.\" Obama spoke less than two hours before the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens played for the NFL title in New Orleans in the most-watched event in U.S. sports. Sunday's game comes as football is under new scrutiny, with more than 1,500 former players accusing the NFL in a lawsuit of hiding the dangers of concussions from them. Another lawsuit was filed in January by the family of former linebacker Junior Seau, who argued his suicide in May was the result of a brain disease caused by violent hits he endured playing the game. Seau's brain was donated to science, and a study by the National Institutes of Health found he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- a neurodegenerative brain disease that can follow multiple hits to the head. Former NFL player wants his brain studied after his death . Obama said professional players \"are grown men,\" well-paid and informed about the risks.

Scientists at the Florida Museum of Natural History on the university's campus examined the 164.5-pound, 17.5-foot snake Friday after it was brought there from the Everglades National Park. It is the largest one ever found at the park. \"This thing is monstrous -- it's about a foot wide,\" said Kenneth Krysko, the manager of the museum's herpetology collection. \"It means there's nothing stopping them and the native wildlife are in trouble.\" Pythons wiping out mammals in Everglades, researchers say . Everglades National Park and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are working with other agencies on the problem of the Burmese python, a non-native but established species in Florida that is one of the deadliest and most competitive predators in the southern part of the state, according to the university. The snakes have no known predator, and population estimates range from the thousands to hundreds of thousands. Previous records for Burmese pythons captured in the wild were 16.8 feet long and 85 eggs. Scientists say research of the snake's biology is important in understanding how to stop the python's spread -- not just in the Everglades, but also in the state and around the world. \"I think one of the important facts about this animal is its reproductive capability,\" said park wildlife biologist Skip Snow. \"There are not many records of how many eggs a large female snake carries in the wild. This shows they're a really reproductive animal, which aids in their invasiveness.\" 16-foot python devours deer in Florida . The snake was so big that researchers had to pile it on top of itself and wheel it into the examination room on a flat cart. They laid it on a series of tables lined up end to end, and then five researchers worked side by side to dissect the length of the snake. The Burmese python is native to Southeast Asia and was first found in the Everglades in 1979, the university says. They were determined to be an established species in 2000. \"They were here 25 years ago, but in very low numbers and it was difficult to find one because of their cryptic behavior,\" Krysko said. \"Now, you can go out to the Everglades nearly any day of the week and find a Burmese python. We've found 14 in a single day.\" There are state laws now that prohibit people from owning Burmese pythons as pets or taking them across state lines without a federal permit. Floridians can also hunt them during certain seasons if they have the proper license and permits. Florida has the world's worst problem with invasive reptiles and amphibians, the university said. In a study published last year in the journal Zootaxa, Krysko found 137 non-native species were introduced to Florida between 1863 and 2010, with pet trade determined to be the No. 1 cause.

There were at least four demonstrations Thursday in the capital Sanaa, local journalists told CNN. Security was out in force, but there were no reports of violence. A much smaller number of people turned out to demonstrate in favor of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the sources said. Egypt is also wracked by protests in the wake of the demonstrations that unexpectedly forced Tunisia's longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to leave the country. Yemen has become a key al Qaeda battleground, with Yemeni security forces carrying out offensives against suspected militants. The United States has sent top officials to Yemen and vowed support for the government's fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as the local branch calls itself. A Yemeni rights activist, whose arrest sparked an international outcry and domestic protests, was released from prison Monday and said there is a revolution taking place in her country. Authorities arrested Tawakkol Karman over the weekend, accusing her of organizing anti-government protests in Sanaa. They let her go after more than 5,000 protesters gathered in her support. She had initially refused to leave prison until officials also agreed to free other activists detained over the weekend, she said. \"This revolution going on in Yemen was inspired by Tunisia's 'Jasmine Revolution' and we are now having a 'Jasmine Revolution' in Yemen,\" Karman told CNN soon after her release. \"The huge amount of pressure coming from the people here will force President Saleh to leave office.\" Karman, who heads the Women Journalists Without Chains organization, said she was arrested Saturday night near her home. People in Yemen are upset because the parliament is considering loosening the rules on presidential term limits. That has sparked concerns among the opposition that Saleh might try to appoint himself president for life. Saleh has been in office for some 32 years and was last re-elected in 2006.

        "input": "London (CNN) -- A landmark ruling which could change the way top-level European football matches are broadcast and sold by television companies was made on Tuesday. The European Court of Justice said that soccer fans have the right to watch sport franchises, such as the English Premier League, on a range of European broadcasters rather than solely via the rights holder designated for each national territory. The court said in a statement: \"A system of licenses for the broadcasting of football matches which grants broadcasters territorial exclusivity on a member state basis and which prohibits television viewers from watching the broadcasts with a decoder card in other member states is contrary to EU law.\" Since its launch in 1992, the Premier League has sold exclusive match rights to a small number of television networks per national territory, a business model which has seen it become one of the richest in the world -- generating an estimated $5.3 billion in income, according to British newspaper The Guardian. Can football chants ever go too far? But the ruling -- in response to a long-running case by BSkyB against a British pub landlady who broadcast a Greek match feed -- now means that consumers could buy decoder boxes from satellite broadcasters from other nations, at a cheaper price, to watch the games they are interested in. BSkyB, which paid a combined $2.73 billion with ESPN to be the main rights owner for the Premier League in the United Kingdom, saw its share price drop 3% on news of the statement. \"It will have implications for how rights are sold across Europe in future, which we are considering,\" a Sky spokesman told CNN. \"As a broadcaster, it will remain our aim to secure high-quality content for our customers based on the rights available to us.\" The ruling's effect could be far reaching if the value of football rights were to be diminished. The large amount paid to the Premier League has seen record amounts of prize money given to top-flight English clubs such as Manchester United and Arsenal -- finance which has subsequently been used to build new stadia and attract some of the world's best players. \"This could drive a coach and horses through Sky's business model for broadcasting of Premier League matches,\" according to Stuart Adams of intellectual property law specialist Rouse, based in London. \"There is every prospect they will find fewer people willing to pay for licenses to broadcast Premier League matches if for a little effort they can get the same pictures via a cheaper overseas feed. When the deal is re-negotiated with the Premier League it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change. \"And if they are markedly reduced, of course, that will have a direct impact on clubs' revenues and therefore their ability to buy and pay the salaries of top talent. That in turn could lead to yet more polarization between the haves and the have-nots of the English game.\" The English Premier League said it would release a statement shortly. Sanjay Nijran, a sports lawyer for Smithfield Partners based in London, told CNN it could affect future revenues for sport franchises across Europe. \"Any broadcasting rights holder that intends to license rights will be bound by this ruling, it appears they will not be able to limit exclusivity to national borders and consequently the value of these rights could be limited. They may have to look for other models,\" Nijran said. \"We're not sure but we would imagine the Premier League would possibly be considering a pan-European license to sell the same broadcasting rights to the continent.\" But it could mean that football fans in Europe are able to pay less to watch the matches they want. \"Currently top-level football is sold to a host broadcaster in each European Member State, you have only one choice of provider through which to watch the match. Now, this ruling allows you to watch on the same terms as any other person across Europe,\" added Nijran, who is representing suppliers of satellite television decoders over the issue. \"What this gives the consumer is choice because through increased competition they are able to choose cheaper providers.\" However, the ruling could have a detrimental affect on English lower-league football, Adams told CNN, as it would circumvent the ban on Saturday afternoon matches being broadcast live -- a regulation which is supposed to protect smaller clubs. \"This would have a huge potential impact on clubs' pricing policies as they are likely to have to reduce prices at the turnstile in order to continue to attract crowds,\" Adams said. \"While this is an issue for Premier League clubs, it is likely to be much more acute for lower-league clubs who are far more at risk of reduced attendances in these circumstances. Such clubs are also more reliant on revenue generated at the turnstiles. \"If the net result of this is more football on the telly for fans to watch, and less money for clubs to lavish on the salaries of their top players, I think most of us would be overjoyed. But if we also see smaller clubs go out of business as a direct consequence, I'm not so sure that football fans will be cheering quite so loudly.\"",

For the sport's superstars the rewards can be huge, with the biggest names earning up to $200,000 per contest. In a country where unemployment is pushing 50%, some young men see it as a way out of poverty. Gris Bordeaux is a star in Senegal, a wrestling champion who also teaches at a wrestling school in the capital Dakar. He says wrestling is a mental, as well as physical, discipline and that reaching the top of his profession takes dedication. \"It's all about making sacrifices,\" says Bordeaux. \"It requires training and meditation; your mindset is important. You have to educate yourself well. \"Not all wrestlers get to realize their dreams, because on the bigger level it is few that get to where I am. You need to be focused on the sport -- like over 5,000 wrestlers you will get only 10 that make it.\" See also: Senegal island exposes horrors of the slave trade .

Wrestlers fight to unite world's newest nation . Lacking the money to use a proper gym, some men have built a makeshift gym of their own. On the city's public beaches they have set up workout benches, using whatever materials they can -- be it car tires or wheel rims loaded with rocks to make them heavier. Some of those training at Bordeaux's school and pumping iron on the beach may one day make it onto the professional wrestling circuit, earning the right to wear the wrestler's traditional pre-fight regalia. Bordeaux describes the costumes as art. He says: \"The way we dress is to show harmony -- we dress for the fight and we become different. When we wear the full attire for a fight, you won't recognize me!\"",

        "input": "NASSAU, Bahamas (CNN) -- John Travolta's lawyer testified Tuesday that the paramedic who drove Travolta's son to a hospital the day he died later wanted money for documents the driver suggested could be detrimental to the actor. John Travolta's son died of a seizure in January at the age of 16. Paramedic Tarino Lightbourne and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater are on trial, accused of plotting to extort $25 million from Travolta after 16-year-old Jett Travolta died from a seizure in the Bahamas. Travolta, who testified last Wednesday, is expected to return to the witness stand later in the week. Travolta's lawyer, Allyson Maynard-Gibson, said Bridgewater approached her in the days after Jett's death on January 2, saying she had a client who had a document Travolta might want. Bridgewater gave her copies of the papers, which included ambulance dispatch reports and a paper signed by Travolta releasing the ambulance company from legal liability, Maynard-Gibson testified. The paramedic expected Travolta would pay millions to prevent publication of the documents because \"he would not want his name tarnished in media,\" Maynard-Gibson said. Bridgewater told Travolta's lawyer that her client believed the documents could suggest that Travolta was negligent by wanting to take his son to his private jet for a flight to a Florida hospital, instead of going directly to a local hospital, she said. Maynard-Gibson said she called police, who then videotaped a hotel room meeting between the paramedic and another Travolta lawyer. Those investigators testified Tuesday, and their video was expected to be played in court later. Travolta's testimony last week was the first time he spoke publicly about his desperate efforts to save his son's life after he suffered a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas. Travolta and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, have been in seclusion for most of this year. Friends have described their deep grief over Jett's death. Travolta said a nanny found Jett unresponsive at the home on the island of Grand Bahamas, where the family was spending their New Year's holiday. A family friend with a medical background helped in urgent efforts to revive Jett, Travolta said. \"We continued CPR, and my wife was holding his head,\" Travolta said. His wife sat in the Nassau courtroom, sometimes crying as she listened to the testimony. Travolta said he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked. Travolta, who is a pilot, said he wanted to fly his son to a West Palm Beach, Florida, hospital instead of driving him to one in Freeport. The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability. \"I received a liability of release document,\" he said. \"I signed it. I did not read it. Time was of the essence.\" Travolta said that while he and his wife were riding in the ambulance with their son, they decided to divert to the hospital. At the hospital, Travolta was told his son \"wasn't alive,\" he said.",

        "input": "Editor's note: Wendell Potter has served since May 2009 as senior fellow on health care at the Center for Media and Democracy, a nonprofit organization that says it seeks to expose \"corporate spin and government propaganda.\" After a 20-year career as a corporate public relations executive, Potter left his job last year as head of communications for one of the nation's largest health insurers, CIGNA Corporation. Ex-insurance company spokesman Wendell Potter says the industry seeks to drive the health care debate. (CNN) -- Having grown up in one of the most conservative and Republican places in the country -- East Tennessee -- I understand why many of the people who are showing up at town hall meetings this month are reacting, sometimes violently, when members of Congress try to explain the need for an expanded government role in our health care system. I also have a lot of conservative friends, including one former co-worker who was laid off by CIGNA several years ago but who nonetheless worries about a \"government takeover\" of health care. The most vocal folks at the town hall meetings seem to share the same ideology as my kinfolks in East Tennessee and my former CIGNA buddy: the less government involvement in our lives, the better. That point couldn't have been made clearer than by the man standing in line to get free care at Remote Area Medical's recent health care \"expedition\" at the Wise County, Virginia, fairgrounds, who told a reporter he was dead set against President Obama's reform proposal. Even though he didn't have health insurance, and could see the desperation in the faces of thousands of others all around him who were in similar straits, he was more worried about the possibility of having to pay more taxes than he was eager to make sure he and his neighbors wouldn't have to wait in line to get care provided by volunteer doctors in animal stalls.  Watch Potter interview with Sanjay Gupta » . Friday morning my former CIGNA buddy sent me an e-mail challenging something he said his wife heard me say in a radio report about my press conference in the Capitol on Wednesday with Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, chairwoman of the House Rules Committee. \"She heard you say that these protestors are funded by the insurance companies. Frankly, nothing would surprise me, but certainly not each and every person,\" he wrote. \"If there was a meeting near me, I certainly would tell my local representative how I feel about this entire subject (and it wouldn't be pretty), and I certainly am not funded by anyone. So I am ultimately wondering what proof there is that seemingly ordinary Americans are finally protesting what is going in Washington and there are all of these suggestions of a greater conspiracy.\" If the radio report had carried more of my remarks, he might have a better understanding of how the health insurance and its army of PR people are influencing his opinions and actions without his even knowing it. Until I quit my job last year, I was one of the leaders of that army. I had a very successful career and was my company's voice to the media and the public for several years. It was my job to \"promote and defend\" the company's reputation and to try to persuade reporters to write positive stories about the industry's ideas on reform. During the last couple of years of my career, however, I became increasingly worried that the high-deductible plans insurers were beginning to push Americans into would force more and more of us into bankruptcy. The higher I rose in the company, the more I learned about the tactics insurers use to dump policyholders when they get sick, in order to increase profits and to reward their Wall Street investors. I could not in good conscience continue serving as an industry mouthpiece. And I did not want to be part of yet another industry effort to kill meaningful reform. I explained during the press conference with Rep. Slaughter how the industry funnels millions of its policyholders' premiums to big public relations firms that provide talking points to conservative talk show hosts, business groups and politicians. I also described how the PR firms set up front groups, again using your premium dollars and mine, to scare people away from reform. What I'm trying to do as I write and speak out against the insurance industry I was a part of for nearly two decades is to inform Americans that when they hear isolated stories of long waiting times to see doctors in Canada and allegations that care in other systems is rationed by \"government bureaucrats,\" someone associated with the insurance industry wrote the original script. The industry has been engaging in these kinds of tactics for many years, going back to its successful behind-the-scenes campaign to kill the Clinton reform plan. A story in Friday's New York Times about the origin of the absurdly false rumor that President Obama's health care proposal would create government-sponsored \"death panels\" bears out what I have been saying. The story notes that the rumor emanated \"from many of the same pundits and conservative media outlets that were central in defeating Bill Clinton's health care proposal 16 years ago, including the editorial board of The Washington Times, the American Spectator magazine and Betsy McCaughey, whose 1994 health care critique made her a star of the conservative movement (and ultimately, the lieutenant governor of New York).\" The big PR firms that work for the industry have close connections with those media outlets and stars in the conservative movement. One of their PR firms, which created and staffed a front group in the late '90s to kill the proposed \"Patients' Bill of Rights,\" launched a PR and advertising campaign in conservative media outlets to drum up opposition to the bill. The message: President Clinton \"owed a debt to the liberal base of the Democrat Party and would try to pay back that debt by advancing the type of big government agenda on health care that he failed to get in 1994.\" The industry goes to great lengths to keep its involvement in these campaigns hidden from public view. I know from having served on numerous trade group committees and industry-funded front groups, however, that industry leaders are always full partners in developing strategies to derail any reform that might interfere with insurers' ability to increase profits. So the next time you hear someone warning against a \"government takeover\" of our health care system, or that the creation of a public health insurance option would send us down the \"slippery slope toward socialism,\" know that someone like I used to be wrote those terms, knowing it might turn many of the very people who would benefit most from meaningful reform into unwitting spokespeople for the industry. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wendell Potter.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- She's been compared to the Dalai Lama, the Chinese Tibetan Buddhist leader, but the name Rebiya Kadeer doesn't ring a bell to many people outside of China. Rebiya Kadeer has been dubbed \"the Mother of All Uyghurs.\" Nevertheless, the world-famous man and the relatively obscure woman share similarities that chime with political relevance. A diminutive northern Virginia resident, Kadeer has emerged as the voice of the restive but relatively unknown Uyghur Muslims, a Turkic-speaking ethnic minority in China, and the group's far-flung diaspora. And like the Dalai Lama, she's revered by supporters and reviled by the Chinese government. \"Even though one is a man, and the other is a woman, they have one thing in common, and that is they engage in activities to split the motherland and damage national unity,\" said Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Kadeer, 62, emerged in the world media spotlight after China blamed her for stoking July's unrest in China's remote Xinjiang Autonomous Region, an area four times the size of California in the northwestern part of the country. Reports vary on the number of people killed, ranging from around 200 to many more. The problems began in late June, after two Uyghur migrant workers at a toy factory in Guangdong province were killed after a brawl between Uyghurs and ethnic Han Chinese -- the majority group in China. Uyghurs protested in Urumqi, the Xinjiang capital, hundreds of miles from the toy factory. Uyghurs and Han reportedly attacked each other. Nur Bekri, the Chinese government's top official in Xinjiang, accused Kadeer and the World Uyghur Congress she leads of instigating the unrest via the Internet. \"The violence is premeditated, organized violent crime,\" Bekri said. \"It was instigated and directed from abroad and carried out by outlaws in the country.\" China's constitution guarantees ethnic minorities equal rights and limited autonomy. And the Chinese government has implemented several programs designed to help ethnic minorities, but Kadeer says China still treats Uyghurs as second-class citizens -- and she blames China for most of the recent unrest. Since the violence erupted, Kadeer has worked the media with a mission, drumming up support for the Uyghur cause and shining a light on what she says are China's \"unjust policies\" toward her people. The estimated size of Uyghur population in China ranges from 8 million to 11 million people, making them a distinct minority in a country of 1.5 billion people. Uyghurs have long complained of being treated as a lesser class, but China has dismissed that charge and touted its commitment to ethnic unity. \"Let them hear our voice and raise public awareness about our situation,\" Kadeer told CNN. \"That's the main thing that I wish to do right now.\" Dubbed \"the Mother of All Uyghurs,\" Kadeer doesn't quite fit the profile of a political firebrand. Born in modest circumstances, Kadeer fell into dire poverty amid the late Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong's forced relocation programs. She worked her way up from laundry worker to become a millionaire businesswoman as China opened to free enterprise. She amassed an empire with department stores, real estate, lumber, scrap iron, factories and other enterprises. She was also chosen as a member of a Chinese National Congress and other posts. However, the mother of 11 children -- some of whom are in jail in China -- wasn't shy about speaking out about the conditions faced by Uyghurs, such as political imprisonment. Her activism landed her in jail in 1999, an incarceration that attracted international attention and condemnation from rights groups and Western political officials. China released her on medical grounds in 2005 amid pressure from the U.S. government. She was granted political asylum in the United States, reunited with her husband, and embarked on activist work. Along with her role as president of the World Uyghur Congress, Kadeer is the president of the board of the Uyghur American Association and the full-time director of the International Uyghur Human Rights and Democracy Foundation. Those groups receive money from U.S. taxpayers through the National Endowment for Democracy, a private, nonprofit organization created \"to strengthen democratic institutions\" around the world. Hugh Pope, author of the \"Sons of the Conquerors: The Rise of the Turkic World,\" describes Kadeer as a skillful and hard-working activist who has done a lot for the Uyghurs. He said she is well-situated in the Washington area, where she has easy access to media outlets, and is a \"natural focal point\" for the Uyghur rights cause. \"She has a canny sense on how to get on top of the situation. As long as she can maintain the Dalai Lama-like profile, she will persist in being a spokeswoman for the Uyghurs,\" Pope said. Dru Gladney, an expert on China and its ethnic groups, described Kadeer as a significant leader who is a charismatic, determined and maternal figure who can move easily among the elites and the common people. She has a message that can unite Uyghurs, and China's criticism of her in some ways has enhanced her stature, said Gladney, president of Pacific Basin Institute at Pomona College in California. \"She seems like somebody all Uyghurs can look up to,\" he said. He noted that her following is \"quite remarkable\" since she is a woman and both Muslim and Chinese cultures are patriarchal. She abhors violence and favors peaceful resolution of conflicts, Gladney said. In that respect, she mirrors the non-violent sentiment espoused by the Dalai Lama, who wrote an introduction to Kadeer's autobiography \"Dragon Fighter,\" recently published in English. \"The Uyghur and the Tibetan people have a history of relationship and in modern times have shared somewhat similar experiences. I therefore hope that this book by Mrs. Kadeer will enable the readers to comprehend the experience of the Uyghur people,\" the Dalai Lama wrote. Kadeer told CNN she has had \"close communication\" with the Dalai Lama. She said \"our philosophy in peace is the same\" and said the movements of both peoples for justice are connected. \"If the Chinese have the authority to destroy one of them, they have the authority to destroy the other,\" she said. China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday that Chinese President Hu Jintao, in a visit to Yunnan province this week, urged all people to show mutual respect and concern. He also said all ethnic minorities are important members of the Chinese family, the news agency reported in a story that did not specifically mention Uyghurs. The Communist Party of China and the government plan to emphasize more strongly developing areas inhabited by ethnic minorities and strengthen support to improve their livelihood, according to Xinhua's paraphrasing of Hu's remarks. In a recent Wall Street Journal essay, \"China's Ethnic Fault Lines,\" Gladney wrote that by the mid-1980s \"official minorities were beginning to receive real benefits from the implementation of several affirmative action programs.\" They include \"permission to have more children (except in urban areas, minorities are generally not bound by the one-child policy),\" paying fewer taxes,  getting \"greater access to public office,\" and better education for children -- in Mandarin Chinese rather than native tongues. Kadeer has spent much of the last few weeks plowing through media interviews and chatting about how she juggles being the \"Mother of All Uyghurs\" with being a mother to her flesh-and-blood children. \"My family is very supportive of my activity,\" she said through a translator. Yet she has spent time apart from her husband, also a Uyghur activist, and children because of political ferment and imprisonment. Kadeer says this is a \"very dark time for the Uyghur people.\" She condemned Chinese security forces for killing and injuring Uyghur demonstrators this month in Urumqi. Unrest also took place in the cities of Kashgar and Hotan, she said. While she focuses on what she says is the Chinese crackdown against Uyghurs in \"East Turkestan\" -- the name Uyghurs use for the region -- she also condemned reported violence by \"a number of Uyghur demonstrators.\" \"Uyghur demonstrators were doubtless expressing discontent over the severe and comprehensive repression they have suffered for years in East Turkestan,\" she said. She cited \"arbitrary detention, torture, and execution\" the repression of their religion, \"forced abortion and discrimination in several spheres, including health care and employment.\" In her talks, Kadeer -- who sports braids and a traditional Uyghur dopa cap -- urges China to \"stop the cultural genocide\" and \"address the legitimate grievances of the Uyghur people.\" \"I do believe that even our enemy would come dine at our table,\" she said, \"because what we have been doing is in a peaceful way. So I do believe that they would come to our table and resolve this.\" CNN's Jim Clancy contributed to this report.",

Mandelson: \"Thankfully, it wasn't paint and I've come through it intact.\" Mandelson had just stepped out of his car for a meeting on carbon emissions when the woman threw the cup of custard at him. She shouted a few words at Mandelson, who rushed inside the building, before walking away. London's Metropolitan Police said it did not arrest the woman because \"no complaint has been made as yet.\" Plane Stupid, a group that opposes airport expansion and aviation-related climate change, identified the protester as Leila Deen, 29. \"It's not right that someone like Peter Mandelson can stand up and talk about being green. The only thing green about Peter Mandelson is the slime coursing through his veins,\" said Deen, who said she works at a poverty charity. Deen disguised the custard in a disposable coffee cup with a lid. \"It was a grave decision that I had to take to highlight this, but we cannot have people like Peter Mandelson standing by and being applauded for his actions on climate change when he's agreed to the third runway and bullied others into that,\" she added. Mandelson indicated that Deen failed to make her point. \"She was so busy throwing what seemed like green soup or something in my face that she failed to tell me what the protest was about,\" he said. \"Thankfully, it wasn't paint and I've come through it intact.\" Mandelson said he wanted to get on with his meeting \"and not bother too much with adolescent protests.\"  Watch Mandelson get \"slimed\" » . It was the second high-profile action this week by Plane Stupid, which has become known for headline-grabbing stunts. Tuesday, nine of the group's protesters broke into the grounds of Aberdeen Airport in Scotland and delayed flights for several hours in a demonstration over expansion. The British government voted in January to approve a controversial third runway at Heathrow, saying it will increase airport capacity and is essential for British business. The government has promised noise and emission levels will actually be reduced as Britain meets European Union targets. Heathrow currently operates at 99 percent capacity. The runway's construction would involve razing areas around the airport, including an entire village and parts of two other towns. Opponents say emission levels will actually increase under the plans.",

        "input": "Tulsa, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Police are investigating whether the shootings of five African-Americans in Tulsa, Oklahoma, were a hate crime after the weekend arrests of two white suspects in the case, local authorities said Sunday. Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 32, are scheduled to be arraigned Monday morning. Tulsa police arrested them early Sunday after a series of tips that led investigators to England's burned pickup, a vehicle that matched a description reported at the crime scenes, according to their arrest reports. The shootings left three dead and two wounded. Both suspects are charged with three counts of murder and two counts of shooting with intent to kill, police said. \"We're going to explore any possible motives,\" Police Chief Chuck Jordan told reporters Sunday afternoon. But he said the investigation was still going on, and Jim Finch, the head of the FBI's Oklahoma office, said Sunday that it was \"premature\" to talk about hate crimes. \"We have yet to analyze all the information to understand the motivations of these subjects in this case,\" Finch said. England had written a racial slur on his Facebook page in a post marking the anniversary of his father's 2010 killing. But the entry also noted his girlfriend's recent suicide, and a man at England's home told CNN, \"You don't know what this family's been through.\" The shootings began about 1 a.m. Friday in predominantly black neighborhoods in north Tulsa. The first victim, 49-year-old Dannaer Fields, died at a hospital. Two others were shot just three minutes later, but survived and were released from the hospital Sunday, Jordan said. Another person was shot and killed about 2 a.m., while the third victim was found around 8 a.m. next to a funeral home. Jordan identified the other two victims as William Allen and Bobby Clark. Investigators have found a weapon they believe was involved the case, said Tulsa Police Maj. Walter Evans, who led the task force assembled to probe the shootings. But he said investigators did not yet know which of the suspects may have fired the fatal shots. Nor was the relationship between England and Watts clear Sunday. Evans said they were not related, describing them only as \"associates.\" Police put out an appeal for tips over the weekend, and there was an \"outpouring\" after a Saturday afternoon news conference, Evans said. Those tips led to England, with one reporting that he was planning to burn a white pickup truck that had been identified at the shooting scenes, according to the arrest reports. Police found the burned vehicle, registered to England, on Saturday evening, leading them to put him under surveillance and get warrants to arrest him and search his home. England and Watts were arrested a few blocks away from England's residence shortly before 2 a.m. Sunday, according to the reports. \"In my 23 years of law enforcement, I don't think I've ever seen any crime as heinous as this,\" Evans said. \"But at the same time, I don't think I've seen such an outpouring of support and cooperation from the community.\" Police reports listed the same address for England and Watts, a home in a rural area on the northern outskirts of Tulsa. An arriving couple who identified themselves only as England's relatives said England's father had been shot to death in April 2010, and England had been left to care for his 6-month-old child after his girlfriend shot and killed herself in front of him a few months ago. \"His mind couldn't take it anymore, I guess,\" the man who called himself England's uncle told CNN, adding, \"I guess it just snapped his mind.\" Earlier, others at the home hurled abuse at a CNN crew that approached the driveway. One of England's neighbors, 83-year-old Synita Bowers, said England \"is a very nice young man, very well mannered. \"He would help me over here,\" Bowers said. \"When his dogs turn over my trash cans, he comes and cleans it up -- very nice young man.\" But on England's Facebook page, a friend warned him not to \"do anything stupid\" after a Friday night message that read \"It just mite be the time to call it quits.\" \"I hate to say it like that but I'm done if something does happen tonite be ready for another funeral later,\" England wrote. And on Thursday afternoon, he noted that it was the second anniversary of his father's death \"at the hands of a f***ing nigger.\" \"It's hard not to go off between that and sheran I'm gone in the head,\" he wrote, referring to his girlfriend. The Facebook page was taken down Sunday afternoon. Authorities would not comment Sunday on any possible link between Friday's shootings and the death of England's father. \"When five black people appear to be shot by a white person, then the immediate reaction is there is a racial component,\" Tulsa Mayor Dewey Bartlett told CNN. \"If that's how the prosecution comes out, we certainly support and will help in any manner, shape or form to bring an end to that point of view.\" About 30 representatives from four law enforcement agencies -- the Tulsa police, Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, the U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI -- had been working around the clock looking for those responsible for the shootings. News of the arrests came as a relief to residents, many of whom had changed their daily habits since the shooting. \"A lot of people in my community were afraid that they couldn't go outside. They didn't know if they could even go to church, didn't know if they could go to the grocery store,\" City Councilman Jack Henderson said. Now, he said, Tulsans \"can feel they are safe\" -- and he said he hoped the cooperation they gave police could encourage others to come forward with information on other still-unsolved killings. \"I get a feeling from my community that there's going to be a better relationship with the Police Department,\" he said. \"The Police Department has shown they can solve crimes, they can solve them fast.\" CNN's Ross Levitt, Randi Kaye, Maria P.

Look, but don't internalize, was the mantra I was repeating inside my head. Tell the facts, explain what you are seeing and what happened. I focused. I don't think I've been somewhere with so much blood on the floor. Over the years, covering wars, I've seen more than my share. Sarajevo, the war in Bosnia as Yugoslavia tore itself apart, was an inoculation against my visceral fear of the red stuff. In that conflict, mortars ripped through crowds of civilians. I soon learned how head wounds bleed. It's different. You don't forget. Here it was again in the auditorium. Dark and heavy. Don't think, focus and do your job, I was reminding myself. But after a while I couldn't. These were children, innocents. Parents not far from here are suffering a harrowing pain none of us can imagine. Parents, whose job in the army is to protect their country, not able to save their own children. The army officer showed us the doors where the children had tried to break out of the auditorium to run away from the Taliban gunmen. The carpet is sticky and red. The floor tiles a mess of the worst of Sarajevo. The Taliban could not have been more callous and calculating. Where the children were most concentrated they turned their automatic weapons on them at point-blank range. Cold-blooded murder. The officer tells me close to 100 children were gunned down right here. Again, I'm telling myself to focus. Explain this brutal cowardly act. Leaving the dark, sad auditorium for the light of day I feel I can breathe better. I look up at the sky. It's the color of hope -- clear blue and not a cloud to be seen. I shouldn't have looked down again. I'm walking over to the classrooms at Army Public School and Degree College. Drops, smudges, pools of blood are everywhere. I'm becoming conscious that I'm trying not to step on them. It seems disrespectful somehow. How, I am thinking, could the Taliban be looking for even more bloodletting when they have already killed so many? But they are. That's when I get to the computer classroom, maybe 30 feet long by 15 feet across. Computers on rough benches down each side of the room. Space for maybe a dozen or so children to hone their computer skills. You didn't have to be rich to send your child to this school, and in Pakistan -- in Peshawar in particular -- on a global scale that implies your means might be quite humble indeed. Quite possibly some of these kids wouldn't have a computer at home. In our ever-interconnected world, lessons in this room could have been some of the most valuable to their futures. And that's it. I'm standing there realizing they have no futures now. The base horror that took place here is startlingly and immediately evident. Chairs still at computers, thick blood pooled underneath on the tile floor. The gunmen came in and before the children could escape opened fire. As I try to explain all this on camera, I can feel my voice cracking. It's not a conscious thing, its what the brain does, a self-defense maybe. Such a horrible waste of so many bright futures, so many parents in pain. It hurts, and there is no getting away from it.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- \"Abolition\" isn't a word you hear much in 2013. It should be, though. And a group of modern-day freedom fighters in Illinois is resurrecting the term -- with its echoes of 1800s America -- to combat ongoing slavery in a faraway West African country. The Abolition Institute, which launched its website on Monday, is a newly formed group trying to end slavery in Mauritania, a remote outpost in the Sahara where an estimated 10% to 20% of people are enslaved, according to a U.N. expert. \"There's just a special connection between Illinois, where President Lincoln and President Grant and President Obama are from, and Mauritania,\" said Sean Tenner, the group's co-founder, who also hails from Illinois. \"(They're) different places, but with the same path.\" Hopefully that path leads to universal freedom. I traveled to Mauritania in December 2011 to report on the issue for CNN's Freedom Project. It's an amazing and gut-wrenching place, full of vast potential but struggling to break slavery's psychological chains. More than a year later, I'm left with a deep sense of hope and cautious optimism that Mauritania will be able to break them. Tenner and his nascent group are one reason for that. He saw the CNN report online in March 2012 and decided he wanted to do something to help abolish slavery in a country he'd never visited, in the name of people who he's mostly never met. \"To say it changed my life and changed other peoples' lives would be an understatement,\" he said. The Abolition Institute has applied for 501(c)3 status as a nonprofit organization, Tenner said, but has not been granted that status yet. Its website lets users quickly petition the United States and other world governments to put pressure on Mauritania to prosecute slave owners \"instead of protecting them.\" It calls slavery in Mauritania \"one of the most pressing human rights issues of our time.\" Tenner assembled a well-connected board of directors to raise awareness about the issue and to collect funds for anti-slavery groups who work on the ground in Mauritania. The board includes veterans of Obama political campaigns, the Save Darfur movement, the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation -- as well as Mauritanian human rights activists who are now living in North America. Paul Rusesabagina, whose story inspired the film \"Hotel Rwanda\" and who is credited with rescuing 1,200 people during the 1994 genocide in that East African country, spoke at the Abolition Institute's grand opening. Tenner, a 35-year-old from suburban Chicago, is following the path of many brave abolitionists in Mauritania -- several of whom I was lucky enough to meet. Since our online project published last year, Biram Dah Abeid, head of one local abolitionist group, was arrested for burning Quornic texts he says condone slavery. Later, after being released, he was given the Front Line Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk by a human rights group in Ireland. Meanwhile, Boubacar Messaoud, head of a group called SOS Slaves and one of the long-standing heroes of the country's abolitionist movement, has provided assistance to women who recently escaped slavery or who come from the enslaved class. Tenner had a Chicago Cubs jersey made with Messaoud's name on it -- and wants to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize. Tenner's first goal, though, is to make people aware that slavery exists in Mauritania, although government officials have denied its existence. And he's smart to do so by forging ties between his state -- home to the American president who banned slavery and the country's first African-American president -- and a country in West Africa that continues to struggle for freedom. \"The more people around the world who are aware of the issue the more pressure will be generated on ... Mauritania,\" he said, \"and the better the situation will become.\" The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.",

On the website early Thursday morning was the cryptic message: \"Thank you for protecting Wikipedia. We're not done yet.\" Clicking on that message takes a Wikipedia viewer to a thank you letter and instructions on how to continue fighting against anti-piracy bills that critics say could amount to censorship. \"Your voice was loud and strong,\" the message said. \"Millions of people have spoken in defense of a free and open Internet.\" Wikipedia was among several websites to shut down Wednesday in protest of the bills. Instead of the usual encyclopedia articles, visitors to Wikipedia's English-language site were greeted by a message about the decision to black out its Web page for an entire day. Why Wikipedia went down at midnight . However, users were able to access Wikipedia on some smartphones. The site and several others went dark at midnight Tuesday; others followed suit later in the day. The protest is in response to the Stop Online Piracy Act bill, a piece of proposed legislation that is working its way through the Congress. A Senate committee approved a similar bill in May called the Protect IP Act, which is now pending before the full Senate. The controversy over SOPA and PIPA has turned into an all-out war between Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Media companies have united in favor of the bills, while tech's power players are throwing their might into opposing them. \"Both SOPA and PIPA are threats not just to the U.S. economy, and not just to all the jobs that this tech sector creates, but if they had existed, Steve Huffman and I could have never founded Reddit,\" said Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded the site.

One member of Congress, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, who opposes the bills, said the unprecedented blackouts had \"turned the tide against a backroom lobbying effort by interests that aren't used to being told no.\" Issa is pushing for consideration of his own plan, the OPEN act, addressing the matter.

Ambassador Ahmad Kattan is returning to his post in Cairo, and Saudi Arabia's embassy and consulate will reopen by Sunday, the agencies said. Saudi Arabia called back Kattan and closed its embassy and consulates last Sunday after raucous protests in Cairo over the imprisonment of Ahmed Mohammed el-Gezawi, an Egyptian human rights lawyer. Throngs of Egyptians had gathered in front of the Saudi Embassy last week, calling for the release of el-Gezawi. The decision to pull out Saudi diplomats came after protesters' \"attempts to storm and threaten the security and safety of its (embassy) employees,\" the Saudi Press Agency said. Saudi officials say el-Gezawi is accused of trying to smuggle thousands of pills into the country. The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights say el-Gezawi had been traveling during Umrah, a minor pilgrimage to Mecca, when he was detained. \"What has happened in the recent days of repercussions in the relationship between the two countries is painful to every honorable Saudi and Egyptian citizen, and our decision to recall the ambassador and the closure of the embassy were only to protect its employees from other situations that could have developed with dire consequences,\" the Saudi Press Agency said, quoting King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz. \"We will not allow this incidental crisis to prolong.\" The protests and the Saudi reaction appear to have again ratcheted up long-standing tensions between the two Middle Eastern nations. The strains can be traced back to 1979, when the kingdom broke off diplomatic relations after Egypt inked a peace deal with Israel based on the Camp David Accords. The ties were restored in November 1987. Egypt, the most populous Arab country, has often engaged in \"a subtle competition\" with its Saudi counterparts \"over this question of regional leadership,\" Cook said.

        "input": "Fighting erupted Friday across Egypt between supporters of Mohamed Morsy and their opponents, leaving more than two dozen people dead and hundreds more injured while raising fears of widening violence after the military ousted the country's first democratically elected president. The violence came as Morsy's supporters held massive protests across the country, calling for his reinstatement, a counter to huge demonstrations among those celebrating his ouster. At least 26 people were killed and more than 850 were injured in clashes across the country that at times pitted Morsy supporters against his opponents and the military, state-run media reported, citing the Ministry of Health and medical officials. Among those killed were five Morsy supporters who were shot by the army in front of the headquarters of the Republican Guard headquarters, where Morsy was said to be detained, the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing -- the Freedom and Justice Party -- said. The health ministry reported that at least two people were killed and 65 injured in clashes there. It did not detail the injuries that led to the deaths of the two. State broadcaster Nile TV, citing an unnamed security source, said live ammunition had not been used against demonstrators and no one was hurt or killed. The fighting broke out when Morsy supporters tried to storm the building, Nile TV said. CNN's Reza Sayah, reporting from outside the building, said he had seen one body around which scores of Morsy supporters were huddled, some of them crying. A few feet away, demonstrators faced off across a barbed-wire barricade behind which stood a line of soldiers who detonated flash grenades and fired tear gas in an apparent attempt to get the demonstrators to move away. Many of them did just that, though thousands of others remained in defiance. Demonstrators could be seen carrying away a wounded man. Some demonstrators waved flags and held pictures of Morsy and vowed not to leave until the military returns Morsy to office. By nightfall, clashes on a bridge near Tahrir Square began after a standoff that saw anti-Morsy demonstrators advance on his supporters, with both sides throwing rocks and shooting fireworks at each other as hundreds of people ran, according to video footage. About 100 soldiers, backed by armored personnel carriers, rolled on to the bridge to separate the two sides and break up the fighting. CNN's Ben Wedeman was reporting live near the bridge when soldiers unplugged his crew's camera and confiscated the equipment. Wedeman said an agreement subsequently was reached that the camera would be returned -- without the video footage. The violence was the latest fallout following Wednesday's move by the nation's powerful military to remove Morsy. Morsy had become the nation's first democratically elected president a year ago, but failed to fix the nation's ailing economy or improve its crime problems and was seen by many as increasingly autocratic. Anti-Morsy protesters eye next moves . Human Rights Watch has said he had continued abusive practices established by Hosni Mubarak, who was pushed out in a popular uprising in 2011 after three decades of iron rule supported by the U.S. government. \"Numerous journalists, political activists, and others were prosecuted on charges of 'insulting' officials or institutions and 'spreading false information,'\" the rights group said. Throngs of protesters filled Egyptian streets for days, calling for him to step down. The president's supporters turned out at massive counter demonstrations.  At times, the two sides  clashed with deadly consequences. On Monday, the army gave Morsy 48 hours to agree to share power or be pushed aside. On Wednesday, the military rejected Morsy's conciliatory gestures as insufficient and announced its \"road map\" to stability and new elections. Morsy and a number of leaders of the Brotherhood were arrested and may face charges over the deaths of protesters during clashes with Morsy's supporters, many of whom also died. Moves spark outrage . Adly Mansour, head of the country's Supreme Constitutional Court, was sworn in Thursday as interim president. Who is Egypt's Interim President? He immediately dissolved Egypt's upper house of parliament, the Shura Council, and appointed a new head of intelligence, state TV said Friday. The moves sparked outrage among Egyptians who saw them as counter to what their fledgling democracy was supposed to have been all about. Mohamed Badie, the Brotherhood's spiritual leader, exhorted the thousands of people who packed the area around the Rabaa Adawiya mosque in Cairo to fight back. \"The coup is illegal and we will never accept its results,\" said Badie, whose title is supreme guide of the Muslim Brotherhood. \"We sacrificed so dearly to reach this point, and we will never return to the past again.\" Badie challenged the Egyptian army to \"return to the arms of the nation.\" The furor appeared to escalate during the day. By nightfall, a car was burning on the 6th of October Bridge, which commemorates the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and leads to Tahrir Square, a focal point for anti-Morsy demonstrators. In Haram, a neighborhood of Giza in greater Cairo, one person was killed and seven were injured when a group of armed men attacked a police station, a spokesman for the health ministry said. At least 10 people were injured in clashes between supporters of Morsy and residents in the city of Damanhour, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) northwest of Cairo, Nile TV said. State television showed pictures from Alexandria of security forces firing tear gas at pro-Morsy demonstrators. Outside Cairo University, throngs of pro-Morsy demonstrators formed human chains while others participating in a sit-in shouted, \"Police are thugs!\" Mohamed Ismail was among those protesting near the university when he said he heard gunfire and saw \"thugs\" appear. They carried guns and knives, he told CNN. \"I saw scores of people falling from the gunshots,\" he said. \"But I do not know how many people were killed and injured.\" Gunshots and birdshot were used in the clashes between the two sides, the state-run Al-Ahram news agency reported. Egypt's armed forces said they would guarantee the rights of protesters as long the protests resulted in neither violence nor destruction of property. Dismantling the Brotherhood? In a move likely to spark further unrest among Morsy supporters, Egyptian authorities arrested the Muslim Brotherhood's deputy supreme leader, Khairat el-Shater, and Salafi politician Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, on Friday in Cairo. Abu Ismail was being held on allegations of inciting the killing of protesters in front of the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Cairo, according to a statement released by the prosecutor's office. El-Shater, who was the Muslim Brotherhood's first presidential candidate before being replaced by eventual president Morsey, was being held in connection with accusations he incited the killing of protesters in recent days, state-run TV reported. The detention of the two men, who are wildly popular among their followers, has raised fears it could spur more supporters into the streets. Police, meanwhile, were seeking hundreds of other Brotherhood members, state media reported. A spokesman for the Freedom and Justice Party said Thursday the coup had turned into \"very, very questionable attempts by the military to dismantle the Brotherhood.\" Opinion: Can the Muslim Brotherhood survive? The Freedom and Justice Party chief, Saad el-Katatni, and the party deputy, Rashad Al-Bayoumi, who were arrested Thursday, had been released, Nile TV, said Friday. The Tamarod, or \"Rebellion,\" movement, which had sought Morsy's ouster, has nominated Mohamed ElBaradei, an opposition leader, to become prime minister. ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, described Morsy's ouster as a \"correction of the uprising of 2011.\" Other opposition leaders and protesters have objected to the use of \"coup\" to describe the military's removal of the elected president via non-democratic means. President Barack Obama said the United States was \"deeply concerned\" about the move, but did not use the word \"coup.\" Washington has supplied Egypt's military with tens of billions of dollars in support and equipment for more than 30 years. Under U.S. law, that support could be cut off after a coup. The United States on Friday condemned the deadly violence following Morsy's ouster. \"We call on all Egyptian leaders to condemn the use of force and to prevent further violence among their supporters,\" State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said. \"As President Obama said, we expect the military to ensure that the rights of all Egyptians are protected, including the right to peaceful assembly, and we call on all who are protesting to do so peacefully.\" Meanwhile, the African Union announced Friday that it suspended Egypt from its ranks of member countries. The AU's Peace and Security Council also said it was sending a team to Egypt to work toward restoring constitutional order. More violence, more deaths . Of the 22 people killed Friday, state-run media reported 12 died in clashes in the northern Egyptian city of Alexandria, where Morsy's supporters and opponents have reportedly clashed for days. Elsewhere, Islamist gunmen attacked Egyptian police stations and checkpoints in the Sinai, killing at least one soldier, agencies reported. A senior intelligence officer who would not agree to being identified said two police officers were killed in the northern Sinai city of Arish when a group of men drove by the police station and shot them. The assaults may have nothing to do with extremist threats to avenge Morsy's overthrow. The desert peninsula next to Israel and Gaza has long eluded the control of Egyptian security forces, leaving extremists plenty of room to establish themselves. The army said it was on high alert, a level below maximum alert, in the Sinai and Suez provinces. The military was enforcing a curfew until 6 a.m. local time Saturday in the northern Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is the largest Arab country in the world and a close ally of the United States, which gives it $1.5 billion per year for military and civilian programs. It controls the Suez Canal, a crucial sea route through which more than 4% of the world's oil and 8% of its seaborne trade travel. With Jordan, it is one of two Arab countries that has made peace with Israel.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Belgium set a date with the U.S. in the last 16 of the World Cup as the curtain fell on the gripping group stages in Brazil, while Algeria celebrated a historic first. Thursday's 1-0 victory over South Korea was more than enough for the unbeaten Belgians to advance from Group H as winners, despite having a man sent off. As their red and yellow clad fans celebrated in Sao Paulo, there were similar scenes of jubilation in Curitiba. Algeria made history in Brazil, reaching the knockout stages of the global tournament for the first time at the expense of Russia. \"Les Fennecs\" -- the Desert Foxes -- will need all their wiles as they face the might of Germany next. Germany had consigned the U.S. to a 1-0 defeat in Thursday's earlier matches but Team USA escaped from a grueling Group G -- which also featured Ghana and Portugal -- on goal difference. Belgium might think themselves lucky to march into the knockout stages with their unbeaten record intact after being forced to play more than half the match with 10 men. Steven Defour was sent off for a rash studs-up challenge on the cusp of halftime and South Korea sniffed blood, pressing forward after the break. But if the statistics tell us anything about Belgium, it is never count them out. Breaking upfield, defender Jan Vertonghen picked up the rebound of Divock Origi's fizzing effort to break the deadlock after 77 minutes. Belgium's last six World Cup goals have been scored in the last 20 minutes of the match. Team USA better be prepared for a lively finish when the two sides meet next Tuesday in Salvador. Algeria had arrived in Sao Paulo buoyant from a 4-2 victory over South Korea -- the North African country's first World Cup win in 32 years. When Russia took an early lead in the must-win showdown, a fairytale ending for Vahid Halilhodzic's side had seemed a remote possibility. Aleksandr Kokorin, who is nicknamed \"Bieber\" because of his youthful similarity to the Canadian pop star, was soon on song. He rose brilliantly to power home Dmitry Kombarov's cross after just six minutes and from there Russia looked intent on protecting the lead. But Algeria, cheered on by the undiminished enthusiasm of their fans, were not done yet. When a free-kick was swung into the box, the Russian defense rocked and Islam Slimani headed into an open goal with 60 minutes on the clock -- his second goal in as many games. The draw was enough for Algeria to join Nigeria as the second African side in the last 16. Meanwhile, Russia will be hoping to find answers before hosting the next World Cup in 2018. After failing to qualify for the 2006 and 2010 editions of the global football fiesta, the Russians have now fallen at the first hurdle in 1994, 2002 and 2014. The remaining 16 nations in the World Cup will enjoy a rest day Friday before the footballing fever gets even hotter on Saturday. Hosts Brazil face a tricky Chile side for a place in the quarterfinals while Colombia take on Uruguay, now rendered rather toothless by the ban for biting striker Luis Suarez. The controversial Liverpool player is not the only star name to take an early flight from Brazil. Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo, Spain's defending champions and 2006 winners Italy were among the big guns saying adeus from Brazil.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- It's a beautiful afternoon on the beach. The sun is shining, you're rolling in the waves, showing off the toned torso you worked on at the gym all winter. Suddenly a sharp, burning sensation hits your skin. You've just been stung by a jellyfish. If experts' warnings are true, swimmers around the world can expect to experience these unwanted love taps in greater numbers than ever before. \"Jellyfish and tourism are not happy bedfellows,\" says Dr. Lisa-Ann Gershwin, author of the recently published book, \"Stung! On Jellyfish Blooms and the Future of the Ocean.\" Gershwin says popular beach resorts around the world are seeing huge increases in jellyfish \"bloom\" activity, a result of overfishing and changing water temperatures. \"The French and Spanish Rivieras, Chesapeake Bay, the Great Barrier Reef, Hawaii ... some of the numbers are staggering,\" says the American scientist who's now based in Australia. \"In Hawaii there have been times that 800 or 1,000 people have been stung in a day. In Spain or Florida, it's not uncommon in recent years for a half a million people to be stung during an outbreak. These numbers are simply astonishing.\" At the beginning of October, a large amount of jellyfish inhabiting a cooling-water intake at a Swedish nuclear plant caused operators to manually shut down production at its largest reactor. Jellyfish prompt nuclear shutdown . In Ireland, a jellyfish bloom reportedly killed thousands of farmed salmon, according to the Irish Times. This past summer, southern Europe experienced one of its worst jellyfish infestations ever. Experts there have been reporting a steady increase in the number of jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea for years. According to a report titled \"Review of Jellyfish Blooms in the Mediterranean and Black Sea,\" written by Fernando Borea for the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean and the United Nations, scientists are catching up to what travelers in the Med have been experiencing for years. \"In the last decade ... the media are reporting on an increasingly high number of gelatinous plankton blooms,\" reads the report. \"The reason for these reports is that thousands of tourists are stung, fisheries are harmed and even impaired by jellyfish.\" Although noting that significant jellyfish blooms \"have been known since ancient times and are part of the normal functioning of the oceans,\" the report cites global warming and global overfishing (which removes jellyfish predators) as causes for exploding jellyfish populations in recent years. The situation in the Mediterranean was dire enough to prompt Britain's foreign office to issue a warning to its citizens vacationing along Europe's southern coast to watch out for jellyfish. The world's deadliest jellyfish . There are more than 2,000 species of jellyfish swimming through the world's waters. Most stings are completely harmless. Some will leave you in excruciating pain. Then there are the killers. Many of the world's deadliest jellyfish are box jellyfish, which refers to the species' cube-shaped meduae. \"There are several species of big box jellyfish that have caused many deaths -- these include chironex fleckeri in Australia, chironex quadrigatus in Japan and related species in Thailand, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia,\" says associate professor Jamie Seymour, a venom biologist at Australia's James Cook University. Also known as the sea wasp and the northern Australian box jellyfish, the chironex fleckeri is possibly the worlds most venomous animal. Its tentacles can reach lengths of up to three meters long, while its bell is about the size of a human head. It can be found throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. A close cousin and fellow contender for the \"world's most venomous\" cup is the Irukandji, which is the size of a thimble. Good luck scanning the waters for that one before you leap in. \"How toxic they are is just phenomenally frightening and equally fascinating,\" says Gershwin. \"Just the lightest brush -- you don't even feel it -- and then, whammo, you're in more pain than you ever could have imagined, and you are struggling to breathe and you can't move your limbs and you can't stop vomiting and your blood pressure just keeps going up and up. \"It is really surprising how many places they occur around the world -- places you would never expect: Hawaii, Caribbean, Florida, Wales, New Caledonia, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, India ... as well as Australia.\" Asian giant hornets and other terrifying creatures . Is any place safe? \"More and more, places around the world that are suffering from jellyfish problems with tourists are developing prediction systems so that tourists can know when it is safe,\" says Gershwin. The irony, she says, is that tourists who avoid an area because of the known risk may alter their plans to hit a \"safe\" beach whose officials are merely less up front about the jellyfish situation, putting themselves more at risk. A common misconception is that places such as Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines are free of dangerous jellyfish. \"Jellyfish occur in all marine waters from pole to pole and at all depths,\" says Gershwin. \"The life threatening ones are found from about 40 degrees north to 40 degrees south latitude. \"Australia is upfront about its jellyfish dangers, and also assertive in safety management, whereas other places have them, but may understand less about them or, in some cases, just don't want to say. I think tourists need to be very aware of local hazards and not expect to necessarily be provided with information.\" What to do when you're stung . Thanks to that infamous \"Friends\" episode that aired in 1997, millions of people think it's smart to treat a jellyfish sting with urine. In reality, peeing on a jellyfish sting isn't a good idea. A report in the Scientific American says urine can actually aggravate the jellyfish's stingers into releasing more venom. Meanwhile, there's debate over what actually works on a jellyfish sting. Many doctors say it all depends on whether the sting occurs place in tropical or nontropical waters. If stung in tropical waters, one should rinse the area with vinegar to deactivate any nematocysts -- the parts of the stinger -- that are still hanging on. \"A freshwater rinse will have the opposite effect,\" says the Scientific American report. \"Any change to the balance of solutes, such as the concentration of salts inside and outside of the cnidocyte [a venomous cell], sets off stinging.\" In North America, doctors recommend using hot water and topical pain killers on a sting. Can we turn this around? Gershwin says the explosion in jellyfish populations is a visible indicator that life in the oceans is out of balance. \"If we somehow managed to eradicate all jellyfish, then something else -- some other weedy thing -- would find a perfect situation,\" she says. \"So the reason we should care is because they act as a flashing red light.\" She says there's no one single factor to blame for the rise in jellyfish populations, but rather places blame on a combination of overfishing, warming water, low oxygen and pollution. By fishing out jellyfish predators and competitors, humans are creating perfect conditions for jellyfish to multiply. \"Sadly, I am one of a growing chorus of people who believe that, yes, it is too late to turn things around,\" says Gershwin. \"So many species are in such low numbers, and habitats are so badly damaged, that restoring them to their original splendor is simply no longer possible. \"I believe that our only option now is to decide how much we value what we currently have, and to decide what we are willing to do to maintain it -- or at least slow down its disappearance. But honestly, can you really see all 7 billion of us agreeing on that?\"",
        "output": "Scientists say jellyfish are proliferating faster than ever before .\nChanging water temperatures and overfishing are behind the surge in population .\nIrukandji, box jellyfish among the world's most deadly varieties .\nContrary to popular belief, treating a jellyfish sting with urine isn't advised ."

        "input": "(CNN) -- The problem with seeing negotiation as a game of chicken is that sometimes you get what you want, but most of the time everyone just gets plucked. That is what I tell my mediation clients, when they take more and more extreme positions, and insist everyone else needs to back down. That is what I tell my negotiation students when they give blustering ultimatums and ignore what the other side wants. And that is what I wish someone would tell the parties in Washington battling over the budget and a looming default. So, what do you do when you realize you're in a negotiation where everyone will be worse off if no one finds a path out? Consider the following: . 1) The immediate problem is not how you got here, it is how you are going to get out. There will be plenty of time later to learn and teach lessons. Right now you need to find a path to a better outcome. Accusations, dissections of past mistakes and allocations of blame will only make it harder to get there. 2) There is no \"they\" on the other side. Parties in negotiation tend to say, \"They are unreasonable,\" \"They are negotiating in bad faith,\" or \"They are crazy!\" Of course, in the current congressional struggle, pundits and politicians are saying far worse (such as \"They are anarchists\" and \"They are fascists.\"). But thinking of the other party as \"they\" empowers the most extreme people on the other side. Instead you need to figure out who is most sympathetic to your position and who is least. And you need to negotiate in a way that empowers those most sympathetic and marginalizes the rest. When a party's position is extreme, responding in an extreme way only unifies the other side's moderates with their extremists. 3) Don't just throw the steering wheel out the window. I recently heard a \"negotiation expert\" on the radio. He said that when you are in a game of negotiation chicken, you should throw your steering wheel out the window and then tell the other side that you can't turn. But what happens when both sides follow his advice? There is a reason you don't see many real games of chicken. And there is a reason that no one actually throws the steering wheel out the window if he or she does play chicken. Those people don't live very long. 4) Keep your eye on your goal and don't get lost in the negotiation game. Strategizing, positioning and winning the negotiation game is exhilarating. But don't get so caught up in the maneuvering that you lose sight of your goals. When Congress agreed that it would give back pay to furloughed employees but not return them to work, everyone lost sight of the goal. Is there someone in the political spectrum who thinks we need to spend just as much money but get nothing for it? 5) Negotiation is not about always meeting in the middle . If negotiations always met in the middle, that would just encourage everyone to take extreme initial positions. Meeting in the middle only makes sense if you are meeting between two reasonable positions. So, an effective negotiator searches for the possible area of overlap between the parties and then tries to maximize the value the negotiator takes away. An ineffective negotiator looks only at what he or she wants and then views negotiation as inflating the negotiator's demands in order to meet back in the middle. 6) Fear can be good. Anger is bad. Too many negotiators focus entirely on trying to scare the other party into making a deal. Not enough negotiators realize they also need to give the other party hope that a deal is possible, and that the deal would be better than walking away. And far too many negotiators push the other side beyond fear to anger. Making others in a negotiation angry just makes it harder to get the deal you want. Why would you ever want to anger the person who has to say \"yes\" for you to have a deal? 7) Insulting the other parties is just throwing away your negotiating capital. If members of the other side feel insulted, they will get angry, and it will be harder to get them to say \"yes\" to anything. And the biggest problem is that it won't matter if you intended to insult them. So, when your worldview is very different from another party's view, be careful that what seems obvious to you is not perceived as insulting by the other party. 8) Playing chicken is for people who love risk, don't value relationships and don't mind losing deals. If you find yourself playing negotiation chicken, make sure you have something to do if you crash. And figure out if the other side is actually prepared to crash. Chicken is for people who like the thrill of winning. Chicken is for people who value getting a marginal advantage in some deals, at the cost of losing other deals entirely. And chicken is for gamblers. Are you one of those kind of people? And, if you are a lawyer, negotiator or member of Congress, are the people you represent those kind of people? Because if they are not, they are likely to be very angry if you crash. And I have already mentioned that anger is bad for negotiators. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael E. Dickstein.",
        "output": "Michael Dickstein: Washington should take note -- negotiation shouldn't be a game of chicken .\nHe says to get a deal the idea is not to blame others but to get out of a problem .\nHe says keep an eye on the goal and remember insults and anger can backfire on the process .\nDickstein: Negotiation isn't about meeting in middle, it's about maximizing parties' takeaway ."

        "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A judicial council on Thursday admonished the chief judge of the nation's largest federal appeals court for having \"sexually explicit photos and videos\" on his personal Web site, but decided against any further punishment. The panel chose not to discipline Judge Alex Kozinski beyond the admonishment. Judge Alex Kozinski, 58, of the San Francisco, California-based 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals previously apologized and had recommended an investigation because of the public controversy over the material. A panel of judges assigned to investigate concluded Kozinski's \"possession of sexually explicit offensive material combined with his carelessness in failing to safeguard his sphere of privacy was judicially imprudent.\" His actions, the panel wrote, \"can reasonably be seen as having resulted in embarrassment to the institution of the federal judiciary.\" But Kozinski was not disciplined because he had removed himself from an ongoing obscenity trial when news broke of the visual material on alex.kozinski.com, which the judge launched in 2002, according to the 41-page opinion issued by the judicial council. According to the council's written opinion, the material included a photograph of naked women painted like dairy cows, a woman shaving her pubic hair, and a video of a half-dressed man \"cavorting with a sexually aroused farm animal.\" Kozinski testified to a judicial conduct panel that much of the material was \"like odd things that I've thrown into a room without looking at them.\" He said some of the files were e-mailed by friends, much of which he did not bother to view. He admitted storing some of the sexually explicit photos, but said, \"I don't know why I kept them.\" The judge also said he never considered his site public and thought he had blocked access to the subcategory file in question, which was labeled \"stuff.\" There was no immediate reaction from Kozinski or his lawyer to the panel's admonishment. Kozinski had earlier apologized to the investigative panel for his \"unfortunate carelessness.\" \"I have caused embarrassment to the federal judiciary,\" he said. \"And thus whatever shame was cast on me personally, it reflected on my colleagues and our system of justice as well.\" The controversy erupted when Kozinski was about to serve as a trial judge -- separate from his work on the higher appeal court -- in a 2008 obscenity prosecution of adult film producer Ira Isaacs. Kozinski recused himself when the Los Angeles TImes published a story about the Web site material, and he later asked for a probe into the incident. The Isaacs case has not gone to trial, but is on appeal over pending motions at the 9th Circuit. Kozinski is not expected to take part in the matter. Kozinski is one of the most colorful and outspoken members of the federal bench. Born in Communist Romania, he emigrated to the United States at age 12 and still speaks with an Eastern European accent. His parents were Holocaust survivors. He was named to his current seat in 1985 by President Reagan, and he was the youngest federal appeals judge in the nation at the time. A mainstream Jewish conservative with libertarian views on free speech, the judge is admired for his writing skills, intellectual curiosity and sense of humor. He is also one of the few federal judges who will do press interviews, speaking with CNN on several occasions about a variety of topics. He also wrote an online \"diary\" for Slate.com a few years ago. He is especially outspoken in oral arguments on his appeals court, and his detractors say he tends to dominate the questioning, often to the dismay of his fellow judges.",

        "input": "Washington (CNN) -- As President Barack Obama and his administration make their case for a military strike against Syria, officials from the president on down worry the regime's chemical weapons stockpiles could eventually endanger America's friends. \"If fighting spills beyond Syria's borders, these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan and Israel,\" the president said in his speech to the nation Tuesday night. The administration and its allies are careful to make sure the case to launch military action against Syria is not seen as being solely motivated by the desire to protect America's closest friend in the region: Israel. Is the CIA arming Syrian rebels? As part of its effort to build support for its position, the administration has reached out to American-Jewish leaders and groups, several sources familiar with the effort confirmed to CNN. With the holiest days of the Jewish calendar being observed -- Yom Kippur begins at sundown on Friday -- the White House has had several conference calls with hundreds of rabbis just as they are readying the content of their sermons. Obama participated in a previously scheduled call two weeks ago in which Syria was a major topic, and Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes took part in a special call Tuesday with 700 rabbis solely on Syria. Rabbi Julie Schonfeld, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Assembly, helped organize Tuesday's session with Rhodes. She told CNN she solicited questions from the participating rabbis who mostly wanted to ask about the \"complex moral and ethical concerns\" of the Syria issue, such as the possible unintended consequences. \"That is what the rabbis were looking for -- more details about how they are addressing\" those questions since Syria is going to be a major theme of their holiday sermons. \"This is not an Israel issue,\" Schonfeld said. \"The Jewish community is always concerned about issues in the Middle East as we ought to be.\" However, Israel and the impact of Syria are part of the unspoken equation. One argument made by the administration centers on Iran -- concerns about its nuclear capabilities and how strongly the United States is willing to push Iran are major points of interest for the Jewish community and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \"A failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction and embolden Assad's ally, Iran -- which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon, or to take a more peaceful path,\" the president said Tuesday evening. Putin slaps down Obama, challenges U.S. exceptionalism . The Iran question also motivated several groups to call for congressional action. About 250-300 activists from the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC descended on Washington on Tuesday, visiting 300 congressional offices, an AIPAC source told CNN. \"This critical decision comes at a time when Iran is racing toward obtaining nuclear capability. Failure to approve this resolution would weaken our country's credibility to prevent the use and proliferation of unconventional weapons and thereby greatly endanger our country's security and interests and those of our regional allies,\" AIPAC said in its statement last week. Now that the White House has asked for a delay in any congressional vote as it pursues a possible diplomatic resolution, there is not the same urgency to help the administration build support. AIPAC has put its lobbying effort on hold for now, an AIPAC source told CNN. Another major influential group, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, also weighed in. \"Failing to take action would damage the credibility of the U.S. and negatively impact the effort to prevent Iran from achieving a nuclear weapons capability,\" read a statement released from the conference last week. All eyes turn to U.S.-Russia talks . Sensitive to any criticism about why they are acting, community leaders insist Israel and its fate are not the reason. \"The decision we reached was not because of outside pressure,\" Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the conference, told CNN, adding American security concerns because of the violation of norms could be \"dangerous in the future.\" It \"was not because of Israel....or pressure from Israel.\" For its part, Israel has avoided publicly discussing the possible votes in Congress on a resolution to give the president authority to strike so as not to be seen as trying to influence the outcome. Also, Jewish activists tell CNN that the history of the holocaust, the idea of a country gassing its own citizens, is a powerful motivator to help push the administration's case. While many of the president's allies in Congress have been reluctant to support military action, he did get some support from one of his fiercest critics. Nevada billionaire and major Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, a major supporter of Israel, told National Journal, \"He is our commander in chief, whether we like what he says politically or not.\" Adelson, who donated more than $100 million to Republican causes in last year's election, added, \"I would be willing to help out the administration, because I believe it's the right thing to do. He is our only-we don't have any other commander in chief.\"",

What inspired her to write \"Red Wired\" was the chasm in online culture on either side of China's carefully controlled borders. \"The information gap between those who are from this part of the world and who know Chinese and those who are from another part of world and who don't is just so huge,\" observes So. \"I've talked to lots of investors, analysts, visitors to Hong Kong, and they really don't know what's happening in China. They ask the silliest questions about China and the Internet.\" \"Red Wired\" tells the stories behind China's homegrown online start-ups, often overtaking dominant start-ups that have been successful in the West but which flailed after venturing into Chinese territory. One anecdote involves an advertisement by Baidu, China's most popular search engine, teasing Google China for not knowing Chinese. Google focused on high-end technology rather than Chinese linguistics. From 2002 to 2005, Google's Chinese site also suffered interference from the Chinese government, which redirected users to Baidu whenever Google's search results failed to comply with China's censorship rules. Although Google China has since learned the lingo and learned to cooperate with the higher order, it still trails Baidu with only 28 percent of the search-engine market share, compared to Baidu's 63 percent, according to a 2008 study by Analysys International. Conquering the Internet with Chinese characteristics . So what are the unique characteristics of China's Netizens? While 25.5 percent of the Chinese population is now online, CNNIC's 2008 statistics sketch a relatively coherent portrait of the mainstream majority of them: 67 percent are below the age of 30; 73 percent have only a high school education or lower; 33 percent are students; and 28 percent fall into the lowest income bracket of under $75 per month. Moreover, 78 percent go online at home and 42 percent log on at an Internet cafe. Once connected, 84 percent listen to music, 75 percent instant-message, 63 percent play online games, and only 57 percent e-mail. In short, for the vast majority of Chinese, Internet means play, not work. One could conclude that an Internet entrepreneur's target audience in China is teenage and twenty-something students, low-end consumers in search of entertainment with plenty of time to kill. Among the most salient of China's Internet start-ups are those that innovated on proven Western models by successfully adapting them to the Chinese market. Tencent, with a 77 percent market share of instant messaging services nationwide, is one of the start-ups that gets it. Tencent is now the largest Internet company in China. \"What really made [Tencent founder] Pony Ma stand out is that he viewed his QQ instant messenger differently from other IM services such as MSN and Yahoo,\" says So. \"They viewed IM as a two-way communication, so made it as efficient as possible. They targeted the high-end white-collar users, thinking they're rich, advertisers will love them, they'll buy additional services. \"Ma thought differently. QQ was a community targeting low-end users -- kids, factory workers. They don't need efficiency, they come online to kill time, to be entertained, to talk with friends, not to do work.\" In a China where economic growth comes at different speeds, So believes that the Internet has leveled out the playing field. \"The online population in China comes from very modest families,\" she says. \"Forty percent go online at Internet cafes, which is the cheapest entertainment alternative you can find. It costs just 30 cents per hour. The poorest kid can afford that, and these Internet cafes can be found in the most remote regions. \"So actually the Internet is flattening out this information gap, if not material gap, because even the poorest kid in China can go online and get information. And because of piracy, they can also download lots of stuff for free.\" Sea turtle power . Another recurring factor of success among Chinese Internet start-ups is their founders' extensive experience working in Silicon Valley before returning to China to launch their own business. A person who has returned to China from overseas is known in Mandarin as \"hai gui,\" which sounds the same as the Mandarin words for \"sea turtle.\" Such entrepreneurial returnees include Baidu's Robin Li, Sohu's Charles Zhang and Ctrip's James Liang. \"Sea turtles bring in new ideas,\" says So. \"Like what is a search engine?\" \"Robin Li was an engineer with a patent on search mechanism, and he wanted to build a Chinese search engine. He brought in the idea, the technology and the funding. While he was still working for Infoseek in Silicon Valley, he got $1.2 million from former executives of Inktomi. Then he went back to China and recruited students and teachers from Peking University, and he built Baidu in a year. \"Finally [the sea turtle CEOs] go to the Nasdaq for IPO listing, because that is where the market really understands the Internet and can appreciate what they did.\" Likewise, China is growing from both foreign interaction and the new technological and political challenges of online culture and commerce. As the \"Great Intranet\" continues to expand and evolve, China continues to explore the fragile balance between censorship and control, and enterprise and innovation.",

        "input": "Two names and two families at the heart of a tragedy. Al-Samani al-Hadi is one of three brothers, and what he calls their \"private family business\" has captured the attention of the world. \"Firstly I want to say, I am the brother of the convicted woman Abrar al-Hadi\", he tells CNN in his first sit-down interview since the woman he claims is his sister -- known as Mariam Yahya Ibrahim in media reports -- was sentenced to death by a court in Sudan for abandoning the Muslim faith. The woman, 27, was raised as a Christian by her mother and is married to a Christian man. But because her father -- who deserted the family when the woman was a child -- was Muslim, the courts consider her to be the same and asked her to recant her faith. She refused, and is now languishing in Omdurman Women's Prison, just outside Khartoum. \"Her name isn't Mariam, her name is Abrar al-Hadi. I am al-Samani al-Hadi Mohamed Abdullah, her full -- older -- brother,\" al-Hadi, speaking to CNN from an Islamic Center in Omdurman, tells us as he rattles off dates and details in an attempt to prove this is the sister he grew up with. He says she started primary school in 1992, and middle school eight years later. He even remembers the score she got on a critical exam -- \"she got a 73.7 percent,\" according to al-Hadi. Al-Hadi says his mother and brothers attended their sister's university graduation ceremony in Khartoum. Nothing, he says, seemed amiss. Then, he says, she met her husband Daniel and his sister. He claims Daniel -- whom he called \"the Priest\" -- fed his sister \"potions\" to convert her to Christianity. Daniel Wani and his wife tell a very different story. They say they were introduced through his sister in 2009 and married in 2011. Mariam, as Wani calls his wife, was a committed Christian -- attending church with a frequency that far outstripped his own. Wani says he never saw the man claiming to be his brother-in-law until the trial began. When I put this to Al-Samani al-Hadi, he tells me: \"Then she is lying to both the Christians and the Muslims.\" \"She went missing in Ramadan [July] last year for 45 days. That's when we went to the police. When she was picked up we found her face was different, the way she looked at us was different. She was bewitched. \"When she stood in front of the court she said her name was Mariam Yahya. We were shocked.\" The case dragged on for seven months, during which time they brought fingerprint and identity documentation, photocopies of which have since been disseminated to local reporters. The documents -- which the court ruled to be genuine -- purport to show that the fingerprints recorded for the national identity card issued in the name of \"Abrar\" at the Sudanese government registry offices were an exact match to those the court took from Mariam. Wani told CNN that even if his wife is released, he fears for his family's safety from al-Hadi and his brothers. Wani is a U.S. citizen and is attempting to secure asylum there for his wife, along with citizenship for his two children. That process, he says, is being delayed by U.S. demands for paternity testing of the children. When asked by reporters earlier in the week if this was true, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, \"Genetic testing is a useful tool for verifying a biological relationship.\" Mariam -- or Abrar -- is currently hoping her that the courts will believe the story of her life as she tells it, according to her husband. She insists that she was brought up by a Christian mother and has never practiced Islam. And in spite of visits by religious scholars and Sudanese government officials pressuring her to recant, it's a story she's sticking to. I found myself returning to the same question time and again in this interview -- is al-Hadi really prepared to see the woman he claims is his sister killed? \"It's one of two; if she repents and returns to our Islamic faith and to the embrace of our family then we are her family and she is ours. We are prepared to hold her dearer than the apples of our eyes. But if she refuses she should be executed.\" Even as all eyes are on Sudan's Court of Appeal, for al-Hadi there is no turning back. \"Why would I indulge my humanity, my emotions and incur the wrath of my Lord? That's not how it works for us.\" READ MORE: Husband of jailed woman fears for family's lives . READ MORE: Sudan's Christians \"scared to pray\" after ruling .",

        "input": "(CNN) -- They may live on separate continents, in different countries with differing cultures, but the same message is being echoed by the world's poor, according to a new report by aid agency Oxfam. Farmers in Uganda have little choice but to attempt to cultivate crops on arid land. The report, \"Suffering the Science,\" tells the stories of people who are discovering to their detriment that long-held truths about seasons and rainfall no longer apply. \"I travel a lot and people are always saying to me, 'the seasons have changed,'\"Oxfam chief executive Barbara Stocking told CNN. \"I think there's a real sense of uncertainty. People have lost confidence. They have a very close relationship with the Earth, nature and climate and suddenly they're finding that it doesn't work anymore.\" People such as Florence Madamu from western Uganda. \"The sun is prolonged until the end of September,\" she told Oxfam. \"And whenever it rains it rains so heavily it destroys all our crops in the fields. You can plant a whole acre or two and come out with nothing.\" July is a particularly harsh month in large swathes of Africa. It's the peak hunger season and this year people are expected to be more vulnerable than usual following record high food prices in 2008. Laborers are planting precious seeds in fields of dirt with no guarantee they'll produce a harvest, while the conditions they're working under are becoming more extreme. \"For me the big worry is that many of them don't know why it's happening so they can't actually help themselves prepare for the changes,\" Stocking told CNN. \"We need to work with them to help them become more resilient -- whether it's cyclones and weather-related disasters or whether it's a long-term change. They need to be prepared for very different sorts of seasons now.\" And for unfamiliar diseases. Higher temperatures are encouraging the migration of malaria and other vector-borne diseases into new areas where, in some cases, health authorities are ill-equipped to cope. Oxfam found Iha at her daughter's bedside in a hospital in Indonesia. Twelve-year-old Laila was the second of her children to contract dengue fever at their home on the island of Java. \"They said that this is a new type of dengue fever,\" Iha told Oxfam. \"She has already had 30 bags of infusion water. After nine days her condition is still not stable.\" It is the stories of people such as Iha who are living with the consequences of climate change that Oxfam hopes will prompt action from leaders of developed nations who are meeting in L'Aquila, Italy this week. \"Ideally what we'd like is the G8 countries to come out very clearly as to what their targets are for carbon emissions reductions by 2020 and the amounts of money needed,\" Stocking said. \"It's unlikely they'll be as precise about that,\" she conceded, adding, \"but we really need some good strong wording in the G8 communiqué about the recognition that for a deal to be done [in Copenhagen], money will be needed for the poorest countries.\" Talks in Copenhagen in December are being billed as an unmissable opportunity for developed and developing nations to agree a global plan to combat climate change. Stocking commended a proposal by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to establish a $100 billion annual fund to help developing nations contend with climate change, but said closer to $150 billion was needed. Oxfam points out that's about the same amount the U.S. government spent on bailing out insurance company AIG. While scientists warn that a cut of 40 percent in carbon emissions by 2020 is vital to avoid severe repercussions, developed nations have yet to commit to anything close. \"We need America to come forward much more positively,\" Stocking said. \"It's really got to stand up to the bar clearly if there's going to be any deal.\" \"We're really pressing as well for the EU to come out much more clearly about what it will do it as a whole. \"There isn't even a Council of Minister's meeting until October and that's going to be far too late. There needs to be some serious meetings including heads of state very quickly now to get an agreement to put something very direct on the table,\" she said.",

        "input": "Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Corey Haim's death is linked to an \"illegal and massive prescription-drug ring,\" California Attorney General Jerry Brown said Friday. Brown's office is investigating \"an unauthorized prescription under the former child star's name that was found during an ongoing investigation of fraudulent prescription-drug pads ordered from a vendor in San Diego.\" \"These prescriptions are very recent, and it involves Oxycontin and we're not talking just 40 pills, more than that,\" Brown said in an interview Friday with CNN Radio. The announcement comes before the coroner has ruled on what killed Haim, the 1980s teen movie actor who struggled for decades with drug addiction. Haim, 38, died early Wednesday after collapsing in the Los Angeles apartment he shared with his mother, authorities said. \"Corey Haim's death is yet another tragedy linked to the growing problem of prescription-drug abuse,\" Brown said. \"This problem is increasingly linked to criminal organizations, like the illegal and massive prescription-drug ring under investigation.\" Brown said the ring uses stolen doctor's identities to order prescription-drug pads that are used to write counterfeit prescriptions. \"The doctor whose name is printed on the form is usually unaware that his or her identity has been stolen for this purpose,\" Brown said. Haim got two powerful drugs from a pharmacy 11 days before his death, according to a source with knowledge of the transaction. His primary-care doctor did not know about the prescriptions and called the pharmacy two days later to find out what Haim had been given, the source said. Brown's announcement did not specify whether any of the prescription drugs found in Haim's apartment after his death were illegally obtained. Several prescription-drug bottles were taken from Haim's apartment, Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter said Friday. Although the bottles indicated the drugs included Vicodin, Valium and Soma, no tests have been done to confirm what they are, he said. Haim had a prescription for the muscle relaxer Soma and the narcotic pain reliever Norco filled at a pharmacy on February 26, a source with knowledge of the transaction said. Two days after Haim personally picked up the drugs, his primary-care doctor called the San Fernando Valley pharmacy to ask about the prescriptions, the source said. The doctor said that \"Haim was not feeling well\" and he needed to know what drugs had been prescribed for the actor, the source said. The source, who worked at the pharmacy, asked not to be identified because his employer had not authorized him to talk. Haim's manager, Mark Heaslip, and close friend Corey Feldman both said Haim began seeing an addiction specialist two weeks before his death. Tiffany Shepis, who was engaged to be married to Haim last May, said on HLN's \"Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell\" that he was taking large amounts of Valium and Vicodin during their yearlong relationship. \"You're talking about a person that, at the time when I knew him, you know, was ingesting 40 some-odd pills a day,\" Shepis said. Although the autopsy showed Haim's heart was enlarged and he had fluid in his lungs, the coroner's chief investigator said a drug overdose has not been ruled out as the cause of the actor's death. \"You can have somebody with an enlarged heart and some other medical conditions, but you don't know if the actual cause of death is from illegal substances, medication or heart failure,\" Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter said Friday. Heaslip said the enlarged heart was evidence that Haim's death was not caused by a drug overdose, but Winter disputed that. \"There were some preliminary findings and we agreed to let the mother know what those were,\" Winter said. \"It was explained to her that even though this is some preliminary findings that the doctor observed, there wouldn't be a final cause of death until the final toxicology tests are back.\" The cause of death may not be determined for another six weeks, Winter said. Feldman, a longtime friend and frequent co-star, asked Wednesday that people not \"jump the gun\" to conclude a drug overdose killed Haim. Heaslip, manager to both Feldman and Haim, said Haim had seemed to be winning his battle against drug abuse in the weeks before his death. Haim was \"weaned down to literally zero medications\" by an addiction specialist in the two weeks before his death, Heaslip said. The doctor \"put him on a new line of medications,\" Feldman said on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" Wednesday. Haim's death came as his career was picking up, with Haim booking \"movie after movie,\" Heaslip said. His latest film is set for release soon, he said. Haim's most famous role was in the 1987 movie \"The Lost Boys,\" in which he appeared with Feldman. Haim played the role of a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire. In later years, the two friends, who appeared in eight movies together, struggled with drug abuse and went their separate ways. They reunited for a reality show, \"The Two Coreys,\" in 2007, but A&E Network canceled the program after slightly more than a year. In a 2007 interview on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" Haim and Feldman discussed their battles with drugs. Feldman told King that he had gotten clean, but it took Haim longer. Haim called himself \"a chronic relapser for the rest of my life.\" \"I think I have an addiction to pretty much everything,\" he said. \"I mean, I have to be very careful with myself as far as that goes, which is why I have a support group around me consistently.\" Haim was born December 23, 1971, in Toronto, Ontario, according to a biography on his Web site. He made his first television appearance in 1982 on the Canadian series \"The Edison Twins.\" His first film role was in the 1984 American movie \"First Born.\" Haim also won rave reviews for his title role in the 1986 film \"Lucas.\" Film critic Roger Ebert said of him at the time, \"If he continues to act this well, he will never become a half-forgotten child star, but will continue to grow into an important actor.\" After \"The Lost Boys,\" Haim and Feldman appeared in \"License to Drive\" and \"Dream a Little Dream.\" CNN's Brittany Kaplan and Jack Hannah contributed to this report.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- In response to an Air Force colonel's overturned sexual assault conviction, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is asking Congress to limit military commanders' authority to toss out court-martial verdicts. \"These changes would increase the confidence of service members and the public that the military justice system will do justice in every case,\" Hagel said in a statement Monday announcing the initiative. Hagel also wants to require commanders who change court-martial sentences to explain their decisions in writing. The effort comes in response to the case of Air Force Col. James Wilkerson. The F-16 pilot was freed last year from a Navy brig four months after a court-martial convicted him of sexually assaulting a woman at his home outside Aviano Air Base in Italy. Acting under the military justice system's Article 60, the Air Force's top commanding officer in Europe, Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin, exercised his power as \"convening authority\" of the court-martial to overturn the conviction. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was among those expressing outrage over the decision. \"As we are trying to send a signal to women ... I question now whether that unit that that man returns to, whether there's any chance a woman who is sexually assaulted in that unit would ever say a word,\" McCaskill said during a hearing in March. Lisa Windsor, a former Army Judge Advocate General officer, said any base commander has authority to do what Franklin did, but \"I've actually never seen that happen before, that a convening authority would completely overturn the case.\" Hagel ordered a review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and Monday's announcement is the result. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretaries of the various services support the changes, he said. \"Despite the attention and efforts of senior leaders throughout the Department of Defense, it is clear the department still has much more work to do to fully address the problem of sexual assault in the ranks,\" Hagel said. \"This crime is damaging this institution. There are thousands of victims in the department, male and female, whose lives and careers have been upended, and that is unacceptable.\" About 19,000 men and women suffer sexual assault each year in the military, former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said last year in announcing a Pentagon effort to stop the crime. Panetta noted that only about 3,200 of those assaults were reported. About 10,700 cases -- 56% -- involved male victims in 2010, based on anonymous reporting collected by the military.

        "input": "A little more than two years ago, Ted Harada felt his left leg weakening, and he found himself quickly running out of breath. Doctors first thought he had asthma, but in May 2010 they told him he probably had ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. In August 2010, doctors confirmed Harada, then 38, had the fatal disease, and he knew it was progressing. \"Every month they [doctors] could see deterioration,\" Harada said. ALS patients lose muscle function in the lungs until they can no longer breathe. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure within three to five years of first symptoms, according to the National Institute of Health. The disease causes nerves to wither and the lungs to stop working. About 10% of ALS patients live 10 years or longer. Harada joined a clinical trial at Emory University in Atlanta, where doctors were injecting neural stem cells -- the precursors to nerve cells -- into the lower spinal cord of ALS patients. Before the procedure, Harada walked with a cane and would get winded just by walking to the mailbox.  He had to quit his job as a manager for a shredding company.  He was so tired he couldn't play with his three children. He was too weak to pick up his youngest child. He couldn't even open a Ziploc bag. Harada hoped the treatment would help, but he didn't expect it to. However, two weeks after getting the stem cell injections in March, he says he started to feel better. \"It's been nothing short of miraculous,\" he says. \"I cannot begin to explain the difference it has made.\" He hasn't touched his cane in months, he says, and his breathing has improved. \"I was afraid I would wake up and the improvements would be gone,\" Harada said. Dr. Jonathan Glass, who is overseeing the clinical trial at Emory, and Dr. Nicholas Boulis, who invented the surgical procedure used to inject the stem cells, explained to patients that participation in the trial would not cure or even benefit them personally, but it would help doctors learn more about how to treat ALS in the future. The first phase of any clinical trial is to prove that a treatment won't injure patients, not that the treatment works, said Dr. Eva Feldman, who designed the clinical trial at Emory. The first part of the ALS study, sponsored by the Maryland-based biotech company Neuralstem, is designed to show that the surgical procedure to inject the stem cells into the spine is safe, and that the patients' bodies won't reject them. According to researchers, the cells did not harm any of the 12 patients in the Emory study, nor did they accelerate the progression of their ALS. \"I need to temper my excitement because it's a very small patient population,\" said Feldman, president of the American Neurological Association. But the facts are not discouraging. She presented early data from the study Monday at the neurological group's annual meeting in San Diego. \"We have cautious optimism that a few of the patients may have slowed in their progression of lower extremity weakness, and one patient may have improved,\" her report said. Of the 12 patients in the trial, two have died. John Cornick's disease had progressed further than Harada's by the time he received the stem cell injections in 2010. He was already in a wheelchair, and he knew participating in the clinical trial wouldn't cure him. But he told CNN in April 2010 that the only way doctors were going to figure out how to cure ALS was to have people willing to participate in clinical trials. \"For me it just seemed like the right thing to do,\" he said. Cornick died of ALS in May.  Another patient in the study, a 39-year old man, died of a heart attack. Feldman said the conditions of eight of the remaining 10 patients have not changed. Based on these results, she and her team in Georgia are asking the Food and Drug Administration to allow them to move to the next part of the trial: Injecting stem cells higher on the spine - into the cervical spinal cord, which is in the neck.

        "input": "(Oprah.com) -- All singles in search of a whine-fest should roll right on past this train stop -- anyone who gets off at Rachel Greenwald's station will be served a particularly strong shot of truth. Her first book, \"Find a Husband After 35 Using What I Learned at Harvard Business School,\" makes zero allowances for always-the-bridesmaid brooding. But for the woman who's ready to vault to the altar, Rachel has a promise: Put yourself on a 15-step plan she calls The Program, and you'll have one foot in that Vera Wang gown. Five years ago, Rachel launched her consulting business, FindAHusbandAfter35.com, in Denver and began teaching clients the same principles she'd used in packaging products such as Evian water (she once served as that company's marketing manager) and Carolee jewelry. \"I'm treating singleness as a marketing issue,\" says Rachel, who calls her program a \"strategic plan\" in which the woman is the \"product\" to be advertised. \"My program is for the woman who is sick of wallowing in why she's single. The point is that she is -- and what will she do about it? What I'm offering her is an objective business perspective.\" But doesn't it seem a tad contrived to market a human being? \"If you were looking for a job, you could call it 'contrived' to put your résumé online, ask friends for leads, and buy a new interview suit,\" she writes. \"But you'd do it -- because you'd be more likely to find a job.... Why is it different with trying to find a husband?\" Oprah.com: 3 tricks for a happier marriage . This from a wife (and now mother of three) who met her husband 11 years ago using her own step number 12 -- \"Event Marketing: Throw a Program Party!\" which means creating a \"strategic networking event\" to showcase yourself. \"I felt so fortunate to have found my husband and to be so happy, I wanted my single friends to have the same experience,\" Rachel writes. As her company succeeded -- \"at least 80 percent of my clients have gotten married within 12 to 18 months of hiring me,\" she says -- word spread. She then took her act on the road with seminars (topic: Marriage 911) and now claims that while a husband is not a panacea, she can tell you how to find a good one faster than you can spell Tiffany princess-cut diamond. The day I catch up with Rachel at Manhattan's Harvard Club, I've come to see whether she can convince me -- the former chubby chick with the Afro -- that her techniques will work. I sashay in wearing a fire-engine-red dress (in her chapter titled \"Packaging: Create Your Best Look,\" she suggests ditching all that black for a color that will differentiate me from the 32 million other single women my age -- 30 -- and older). Perhaps because she's already married, she can justify her black suit, Jackie O chic as it is. Our quick phoner the previous day -- we were two strong gusts of energy spinning toward each other -- immediately becomes, upon meeting, a whirlwind exchange of chatter and laughter that draws glances from a few blue bloods around us. Rachel, who enunciates each of her syllables with English-teacher perfection, oozes intensity with every gesture she uses to punctuate her rapid-fire statements. She whisks me to an empty sitting room, seldom shifts her gaze from me as she listens to my dating history, then insists, as the pitch of her voice climbs, that The Program can rescue me. \"When you sign up 100 percent for anything -- whether it's losing weight, finding a job, or quitting an addiction, I have no doubt that it becomes a challenge you can rise above,\" she tells me. \"I've seen what the power of focus can do for a woman who's committed not just in words but in action.\" Oprah.com: Test your intimacy quotient . Me, too -- which is why Rachel is my kind of gutsy girl: all the kick of Cheddar on rye, minus any trace of baloney. As in this bit of bluntness she delivers in her chapter \"Telemarketing: Bring Out Your Rolodex\": \"Let me tell you right up front that you're not gonna like this step!\" she writes. \"But trust me, it can yield very good results... You are going to call everyone you know and directly ask them to fix you up.\" That means all human life forms currently listed in your Palm V -- landlords, lawyers, grannies, hairstylists, florists, stockbrokers, long-lost gal pals from summer camp, former colleagues, and even old boyfriends you're still on good terms with. Oh, exhale: This approach needn't make you seem desperate. \"Each person will probably think you're calling two or three friends, not two or three hundred,\" Rachel says. She estimates, based on her experience with clients and her business school training, that you'll score one blind date for every ten calls. \"Why go through this torture?\" she writes. \"This statistic says it all: 'Fifty percent of people now married or living together were introduced by good friends or family members.'\" After poring over the 15 steps -- everything from \"Make The Program Your Number One Priority\" to \"Pump Up the Volume\" (\"My approach gives you the tools to attract the highest number of men quickly and efficiently\") -- I decide to test-drive creating a \"personal brand.\" \"This is what sets you apart from your competitors -- and to be effective, it must be memorable and specific,\" she explains. \"Madonna's brand might be 'outrageous, sexual pop singer.' We're all multifaceted, so you need to give your friends who'll set you up on blind dates a shorthand way of summing you up.\" This, she says, derives from the business principle that a well-defined brand is essential to the success of any product, be it Jo Malone fragrance, the U.S. mail, or you. Not only should your brand ring true to your \"customers\" -- the people you'll ask to scare up dates for you or the countless men with whom you'll click Cosmo glasses -- it should also be designed to attract the kind of partner you're looking for. Oprah.com: How to build intimacy in your relationships . Rachel has me draw up a megalist of my most appealing attributes, like \"resilience\" and \"playfulness.\" Then I choose three (\"writer,\" \"warm smile,\" and \"grew up in Phoenix\") as a basis for a brand -- \"sunny girl from Arizona.\" On the two websites where I've posted a profile, I update my photo (in the old one, we agree, the bad lighting doesn't exactly say \"sunny girl\"). I then begin \"advertising\" by calling every girlfriend I have and asking for a setup. This move alone nets me three dates. For those who snatch up Rachel's book, I suggest enlisting the help of a supporter (in step two, she suggests you find a \"program mentor,\" preferably someone married) who won't be any less shy than Rachel about delivering the hard news straight. (After seeing my potential online photo, in which I'm sitting on a bed, she asks, \"Do you want a husband or a one-night stand?\") In this program, the truth is the essential bottom layer upon which your entire five-tier wedding cake will stand. Within two weeks of trying Rachel's strategies, I, the girl who once spent Friday nights booting up Tivo for an \"American Idol\" marathon, am now juggling so many suitors that I've started a \"man-agement\" diary. One of my dates has even led to a second, a third, and a fourth. What a difference a brand -- and perhaps 12 to 18 months -- can make. Oprah.com: Marriage traps to look out for .

        "input": "Catholic bishops \"will be held accountable\" for failing to protect children from sexual abuse, Pope Francis said Monday, his strongest acknowledgment yet of what abuse victims have been saying for decades: that the cover-ups have often been as bad as the crimes. But without strong action to back up those words, such groups are likely to view Francis' comments as little more than lip service. Vatican officials have so far been reluctant to take action against bishops accused of concealing abuse. In a homily given during a private Mass with six victims of church sexual abuse, Francis apologized for the abuse and asked for forgiveness. \"I beg your forgiveness, too, for the sins of omission on the part of Church leaders who did not respond adequately to reports of abuse made by family members, as well as by abuse victims themselves,\" Francis said in the homily, according to a text of the statement provided by the Vatican. \"This led to even greater suffering on the part of those who were abused and it endangered other minors who were at risk,\" he said. In his homily, Francis said that \"all bishops must carry out their pastoral ministry with the utmost care in order to help foster the protection of minors, and they will be held accountable.\" Despite the strong words, a victims advocacy group, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said Monday's session failed to advance the cause of preventing molestation by priests, arguing that \"no child on earth is safer today because of this meeting.\" \"Let's not mistake this meeting today for real action,\" SNAP President Barbara Blaine told CNN. \"The meeting today will not make children safer.\" \"I think that Pope Francis has yet to take strong action that will protect children and he could do that by firing the bishops who have been complicit and who are transferring predators,\" she said. Opinion: Pope's apology on sex abuse still doesn't cut it . Francis has called for \"zero tolerance\" of sexual abuse by clerics, and last week a Vatican tribunal defrocked Polish Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski after finding him guilty of sexual abuse of minors. CNN religion commentator Rev. Edward Beck said that was a sign of change. \"So what people have been calling for with regards to the hierarchy needing to accept responsibility and action be taken against them has already begun to happen,\" he said. Blaine rejected the notion Wesolowski's defrocking was a major shift, saying church officials had covered up for him in the past and have failed to do enough to facilitate his prosecution in the Dominican Republic, where at least some of the abuse was alleged to have occurred. Monday's meeting between Francis and the six victims of church sexual abuse was not the first such meeting between a pontiff and survivors, but it was the first of Francis' papacy. It involved three men and three women from Britain, Ireland and Germany who met privately with Francis for about 30 minutes in his private residence at Casa Santa Marca, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi told reporters. The abuse survivors also celebrated Mass with Francis. Lombardi said the victims emerged from the meeting moved by what he described as a \"profound spiritual encounter and dialogue.\" \"If you had seen the people coming out of the meeting, it would have been totally, absolutely clear that it was not a publicity stunt,\" Lombardi said, reacting to a statement last month by SNAP calling the meeting \"self-serving.\" \"The most important thing the Pope hopes to come out of this occasion, is that the victims themselves felt welcomed and listened to,\" Lombardi said. In his homily, Francis acknowledged that sexual abuse by priests has had profound consequences on victims. \"Many of those who have suffered in this way have also sought relief in the path of addiction,\" he said. \"Others have experienced difficulties in significant relationships, with parents, spouses and children. Suffering in families has been especially grave, since the damage provoked by abuse affects these vital family relationships.\" \"Some have even had to deal with the terrible tragedy of the death of a loved one by suicide,\" Francis told the victims. \"The deaths of these so beloved children of God weigh upon the heart and my conscience and that of the whole Church.\" Francis became Pope in March 2013. While critics have said he should have met with victims earlier, Francis has said he believes the Church has been unfairly attacked. The Pope asked Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the archbishop of Boston, to help organize the meeting. O'Malley is a member of a new commission spearheaded by Francis -- the Commission for the Protection of Minors -- to advise him on ways to help move forward after the Church's sex abuse crisis. One member of the group is a woman who was a sex abuse victim.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- There is mounting evidence that the electoral threat from the tea party is fading. In the power struggle between the tea party faction of the GOP and the \"establishment,\" the establishment is winning. Party primaries are an imperfect way to measure the direction in politics. The news from one week can be overshadowed by what happens a few weeks later. Primaries are just snapshots of the political landscape at a given moment. But at least this week the news for tea party advocates was not good. The primaries are providing evidence as to how much of a threat the Republican leadership really faces when opponents attempt to unseat them for moving too far to the center. House Speaker John Boehner faced a twin tea party challenge from Republicans who claim he has been too willing to compromise. The tea party campaign in his district picked up some steam after the speaker made disparaging remarks about colleagues who were holding up the immigration bill. Tea party candidates J.D. Winteregg and Eric Gurr both went after him. But Boehner enjoyed an easy victory Tuesday, putting aside speculation that discontent with his recent statements about immigration and the budget might cause him problems. There was never a genuine threat that he would be unseated, but a strong showing by his opponents would have been enough to send some shock waves to Washington. It didn't happen. A more serious contest is taking place in Kentucky, where on May 20, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell faces off against tea party Republican Matt Bevin. Thus far, all the evidence suggests that McConnell will do just fine in the primary. The primaries are also telling us something about the status of immigration as an issue in the GOP. The immigration reform legislation that passed the Senate has been held up by a faction of House tea party Republicans, equaling about 30 to 40 members, who have been steadfast in their refusal to let a bill pass. The opposition as well as threats of political harm made against anyone who dares speak in favor of reform has been a major barrier to passing legislation. Yet the evidence is still thin that taking a hard-line, anti-immigration stance is the only way for a Republican to survive. As Politico recently noted, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's pro-reform group FWD.us has argued that the threat has been exaggerated, pointing out that few Republicans who have supported immigration reform have lost. GOP establishment 1, tea party 0 after NC Senate primary . \"Purely from a quantitative standpoint, the percentage of GOP primary voters who are hostile to what we might call ... all manner of immigration reform is pretty low,\" said Jon Lerner, a pollster working for Zuckerberg's organization. Two Texas Republicans, Sam Johnson and John Carter, survived their primaries despite working on the immigration bill in the House. In his primary in March, Johnson won with more than 80% of the vote. This week in North Carolina, Rep. Renee Ellmers defeated Frank Roche, a former currency trader, who targeted her for support for more liberal policies toward immigrants. \"If an individual wants to come to this country to work, to provide for his family and to contribute to his community, he should be allowed to do so,\" she wrote. Roche attacked her for supporting \"de facto amnesty.\" Ellmers won. The victory provides more evidence that proponents of immigration reform, and there are many, can move forward with legislation and survive. As one expert at Cornell Law School told CNN, \"If the primaries in spring and summer show immigration is not that big an issue with activists, then Republicans will feel they can go out on the limb and support reform.\" The final lesson Tuesday has to do with the organizational and financial muscle of the tea party. Is it mostly bark, but no bite? This has been an issue that has dogged the tea party since it emerged in 2010. Can these activists really match the money and resources of the establishment? In certain campaigns, establishment organizations, allied with business, have been putting substantial amounts of money to shape the outcome. They spent big to support conservative candidates who would be viable in the general election against Democrats. In North Carolina, the primary between Thom Tillis, Mark Harris and Greg Brannon for the Republican candidacy in the race for the Senate seat currently held by Kay Hagan has been the center of attention. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky traveled to North Carolina to announce his support for Brannon. Groups such as American Crossroads -- Karl Rove's organization -- have invested millions to back their candidate, Tillis. Once again, the establishment won. Tillis secured well over the 40% threshold he needed to avoid some kind of runoff. His victory offers more fodder for those who have argued that tea party organizations such as the Tea Party Patriots and the Madison Project have been ineffective, squandering resources by spending more on fund-raising and direct mail than on their candidates. Brian Walsh, who had worked for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, even downplayed their ability to shape the grass roots. \"Their influence in terms of on-the-ground activity and spending money is greatly overstated. ... Their influence has generally been in the echo chamber, with talk radio and blogs.\" It's important that this trend should not be seen as a victory of \"moderate\" Republicans over \"far right\" Republicans. The truth is that the entire GOP has shifted to the right, and these are all contests between different factions of conservative Republicanism rather than a true ideological war within the party. The tea party still has a lot to prove. This week's primaries only made its case that much harder. There are still opportunities for tea party Republicans to show they can deliver a punch on the campaign trail. But more poor showings at the polls will continue to strengthen the Republican establishment in its effort to quash the tea party as a political power in its caucus.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Since 2½-year-old Ava Zinna ended up in the emergency room  this summer after an allergic reaction to peanuts, her mother, Tara, has worried about her daughter's food whenever they eat out. But when the family went to Blue Smoke restaurant Sunday afternoon in New York, someone had already asked to hold the peanuts. Ava Zinna ate an allergen-free meal at the Worry Free Dinners event on Sunday. The Zinnas took part in Worry Free Dinners, a series of monthly meals for people with food allergies. Sunday's 16-person barbecue -- complete with ribs, chicken, burgers and brownies -- was the first event aimed directly at parents and children affected by food allergies. \"When you're going into a restaurant environment, you're putting your child's safety and livelihood into other hands,\" Tara Zinna said. At the Worry Free Dinners event, \"not only was the food phenomenal, but it's wonderful to have an opportunity to interact with other families who are dealing with similar issues.\" The recent \"worry free\" meal event took place just days before the Food and Drug Administration's September 16 public hearing on food ingredient labels. Since 2006, food manufacturers have been required to clearly label products that contain any of the most common allergens -- milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat and soy -- but some allergy experts say the labels should be more explicit. Restaurant dining can be a terrifying experience for people with severe food allergies. When the meal arrives, there's often no way of knowing every single ingredient that went into it, or what else touched the plate and utensils used to serve it. You also have to pester the restaurant staff with special requests. But with Worry Free Dinners, everyone has some kind of experience with all of that, which helps build camaraderie, said Sloane Miller, who started organizing the events in April.  Read more tips on how to manage food allergies » . \"People sit down and start chatting immediately like they're old friends,\" said Miller, known in the blogosphere as \"Allergic Girl.\" \"It's so nice to be with people that you don't have to explain [to] why you want something on the side.\" So far, Worry Free Dinners has catered to food allergy sufferers in New York -- there are about 12 million in America, according to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) -- but Miller is looking to take the concept to other cities. A common but mysterious condition . One out of every 17 children under 3 years old in America has a food allergy, and some will outgrow their sensitivities, said Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder and CEO of FAAN. But allergies to peanuts, nuts, shellfish and fish tend to be lifelong, she said. As far as she knows, Worry Free Dinners is the first event series of its kind. Experts agree that allergies in general -- both food and inhalant -- are on the rise, but no one is sure why. Research on food allergies has been slow because \"for a long time, people thought this was a small problem,\" Munoz-Furlong said. The largest group of studies on the subject are in progress, including immunotherapy for people with peanut and milk allergies, she said. The majority of food allergy cases -- about 80 percent -- are \"cyclic,\" with mild symptoms that resemble those of pollen or dust allergies: sneezing, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion, said Dr. Alpen Patel, assistant professor of otolaryngology at Emory University. Other people experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhea consistently in response to certain foods. But for some people, ingesting something that even accidentally touched tree nuts or peanuts could result in anaphylaxis, a severe reaction that can lead to blocked airways, cardiovascular collapse, and even death. This is called a \"fixed food allergy,\" he said. After one severe reaction, he said, most people consistently avoid the offending food and do not experience another severe attack. But they also always carry a shot of epinephrine to self-administer immediately in case they experience signs of anaphylaxis. Enjoying food in spite of allergies . Miller has made a career of helping people with food allergies and other special dietary needs navigate their meals, whether at Thanksgiving or on a date, without feeling sick. She runs her own coaching practice, blogs and organizes Worry Free Dinners events under her umbrella organization Allergic Girl Resources Inc. She herself has dealt with allergies all her life -- as a baby she developed a rash when her mother switched from breast milk to cow's milk, and at age 2 she had a reaction to tree nuts. She has since learned that she also has some form of allergy to salmon, lemon grass, eggplant, some types of melons and most tropical fruits. But Miller, now 36, did not want her food allergies to prevent her from sampling the cornucopia of New York City restaurants. She developed relationships with restaurants that would accommodate her needs, and began organizing dinners for people who have similar allergy problems. \"It is both worry-free for the diner and worry-free for the restaurant,\" she said. \"Restaurants appreciate that I'm looking out for them as well ... I want to make it as easy as possible for them to have people like me come in all the time.\" Where everybody knows your name . So how does someone like Miller, who lives with food allergies plus a \"wheat/gluten-free, processed sugar-free, lactose-free, soy-free, low processed food-free lifestyle,\" safely enjoy eating out? Miller calls it the \"Cheers\" experience. The first time she goes to a restaurant, she always calls ahead and talks with the restaurant management to make sure they can accommodate her before making a reservation. Once at the restaurant, she'll meet the manager and give him or her a card with a run-down of her special dietary needs. Often a chef will join Miller and the manager to discuss the menu. By this point, Miller says, everyone has been introduced by name. After the meal, Miller thanks the server, chef and manager, and tips the server generously. She'll often call the next day and thank the manager for helping her eat safely. On her blog, allergicgirl.blogspot.com, Miller finds no shortage of restaurant meals to recommend and photograph. She'll find creative alternatives to traditionally prepared foods that look no less appetizing than more familiar versions -- for instance, she recently had fish-free sushi made of potato tempura, sticky rice, avocado and sesame seeds. Not every restaurant will accommodate Miller's special needs -- she has been refused service at some restaurants. But in general, she's found that restaurants have become far more understanding than five years ago, if only because staff members have children with food allergies. \"That changes how they run their kitchen,\" she said. \"More and more people are touched by this, and do get it.\"",

        "input": "(CNN) -- The first bodies to be recovered from the crash of Air France 447 arrived at a Brazilian Air Force base in Recife, Brazil, Wednesday, the air force announced. Brazilian pilots and a medical team bring one of the first bodies ashore at Fernando de Noronha island. The 16 bodies were taken to the Legal Medical Institute in Recife for identification, the statement said. Police will perform DNA tests at their lab in the capital, Brasilia, if necessary, they said. Another 25 bodies have been found and will go through the same procedure starting Thursday, the air force said. Official identification of the bodies will be made only by the Legal Medicine Institute, even if any of the bodies could have been identified while on Fernando de Noronha, the islands where they were first brought after being recovered. A French nuclear submarine joined the hunt Wednesday for the flight data recorders and other wreckage from Air France Flight 447 as Brazilian air force and navy crews continued to pull bodies from the Atlantic. Bad weather and poor visibility are expected in the search area, Brazilian Air Force spokesmen said. France is leading the investigation into what caused last week's accident when the Paris-bound flight from Rio de Janeiro plunged into the sea off the Brazilian coast with 228 passengers and crew on board. The French nuclear submarine Emeraude began patrolling the area Wednesday morning, the French defense ministry said. Around 400 French military personnel are involved in the salvage effort. France has also sent two tugs towing 40 tons of recovery equipment, a surveillance ship and a ship equipped for amphibious operations. Fourteen aircraft -- 12 Brazilian and two French -- are participating, along with five Brazilian ships. The U.S. Navy will contribute two high-tech acoustic devices to listen underwater for the emergency beacons that are attached to the voice and data recorders. The \"towed pinger locators,\" which help search for emergency beacons on downed aircraft to a maximum depth of 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) -- will be placed aboard the French tugs. Watch challenges faced by search crews » . Brazilian officials emphasized earlier this week that finding bodies was their main priority. The French are in charge of finding the voice and data recorders. The 16 bodies retrieved Tuesday from the Atlantic were taken to the island of Fernando de Noronha for transport by helicopter to Recife. The 25 bodies previously found were put aboard a Brazilian frigate. Watch bodies being returned to land » . The first bodies were recovered about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of the Brazilian archipelago of Saint Peter and Saint Paul; Tuesday's recoveries were 80 kilometers (50 miles) away.  See photos of bodies arriving at Fernando de Noronha » . It was not clear whether the bodies had drifted in the 1-2 knot currents or whether their separation suggested that the jet may have broken apart in the air. The location of the crash has not been determined, because ocean currents have moved the bodies and debris. The search area covers 200,000 square km (77,220 square miles), Brazilian officials said.  Map of Flight 447's flight path » . The ocean depth where the debris and bodies have been found varies, but averages about 3,000 meters (nearly 9,900 feet) deep, according to the University of New Hampshire/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association Joint Hydrographic Center. Brazilian officials said the plane debris will be taken to France for investigation but the bodies would undergo forensic tests in Recife. The cause of the crash is still not known, but investigators are looking at the possible role of airspeed sensors known as Pitot tubes, among other factors.  Did plane's tail fin snap off? » . Air France has agreed to replace the sensors on its Airbus A330 and A340 jets, a pilots' union said Tuesday. The airline said Saturday that it began replacing its fleet's sensors last month. Another Air France pilots' union, ALTER, has advised its pilots not to fly planes until their Pitot tubes are replaced. ALTER, the smallest of three Air France pilots' unions, would not say what percentage of the carrier's pilots it represents. The biggest union, SNPL, said Tuesday it has accepted Air France's assurances that no Airbus A330 or A340 will take off unless at least two of its three Pitot tubes have been replaced. Union spokesman Eric Derivry added that there is no indication that the Pitot tubes caused the accident. Air France said over the weekend that it began to notice in May of last year that Pitot tubes sometimes briefly iced up at high altitude on A330s and A340s. That caused \"a loss of airspeed data,\" according to the airline -- that is, the pilots didn't know the plane's speed. Air France decided to replace all its probes starting April 27, following laboratory tests earlier in the year, the airline said.

        "input": "Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was able to stand with assistance on Wednesday, an aide said, with her doctor adding that the congresswoman has the strength to stand on her own. \"Today we were getting her out of bed again and we were able to stand with assistance,\" said Dr. Peter Rhee, Tucson's University Medical Center's trauma chief. \"She's got the strength to stand on her own, lift her head up and these ... I see improvements every single day.\" Rhee was speaking to CNN affiliate KVOA. Giffords' chief of staff, Pia Carusone, told CNN Wednesday that Giffords had stood Wednesday \"with assistance.\" A federal grand jury in Tucson indicted Jared Lee Loughner on three charges of attempted murder on Wednesday. Loughner, 22, was charged with attempting to kill Giffords and two of her aides, Ron Barber and Pamela Simon. \"We are in the early stages of this ongoing investigation,\" said U.S. Attorney Dennis K. Burke in a statement about the charges. \"This case also involves potential death-penalty charges, and (Justice) Department rules require us to pursue a deliberate and thorough process,\" the statement went on. \"Today's charges are just the beginning of our legal action.\" Federal law requires the U.S. to bring charges against of a defendant within 30 days of his or her arrests. Legal experts said that more federal charges against Loughner are likely. \"This is really a placeholder indictment,\" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Wednesday. \"The grand jury investigation will continue, there's a long way to go in these case and these charges will be there but I'm certain there will be more as well.\" In addition to standing on Wednesday, Giffords' doctor said she was put in a chair and was able to look out a window. \"We went to a window and so she could see the mountains of Tucson,\" Rhee said. \"There's no doubt in my mind that lifted up her spirits.\" The congresswoman, who will be moved to a rehabilitation center in Texas later this week, had worries about her safety long before she was critically wounded by a gunman at a public event this month, her husband said on Tuesday. \"We've discussed it a number of times,\" Mark Kelly told KVOA. \"She felt that that was a possibility, pretty much exactly what had happened ... there have been threats against her and other members of Congress.\" Giffords was hosting a constituents' meeting outside a supermarket in Tucson when a gunman opened fire. Six people, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl, were killed and 13 others wounded. Giffords was shot in the head. In an e-mail sent to friends and family members Tuesday and obtained by CNN, Giffords' mother, Gloria, writes that she will be moved from Tucson's University Medical Center to rehabilitation facilities in Houston on Friday. \"There is a team of medical specialists involved ... including military surgeons who specialize in bullet wounds to the head,\" the e-mail says. \"They want to start aggressive rehab immediately.\" Giffords' office confirmed the move and said that while the move is expected to be Friday, \"the exact day of the move will depend on the congresswoman's health.\" Her family chose TIRR Memorial Hermann rehabilitation hospital in Houston, part of the Texas Medical Center, because of its reputation, one of her doctors said. \"The congresswoman's family wants to ensure she receives the best rehabilitative care possible for her type of serious penetrating brain injury,\" said Dr. Michael Lemole. Kelly said that Memorial Hermann's proximity to Tucson was another factor in the decision. \"I am extremely hopeful at the signs of recovery that my wife has made since the shooting,\" he said. \"The team of doctors and nurses at UMC has stabilized her to the point of being ready to move to the rehabilitation phase. Their goal -- and our goal -- has been to provide Gabby with the best care possible.\" Loughner is next set to appear in court on Monday in Phoenix. Richard Kastigar, chief investigator for the Pima County Sheriff's Department, said Wednesday authorities believe he showed his gun to a friend before the shooting, \"between Christmas and New Year's.\" After the shooting, the friend told his father about the exchange, and the father contacted police, he said. He would not name the friend. Police have said Loughner bought the gun in November after passing a background check, and bought ammunition at a Walmart near his home hours before the shooting. Seven boxes of ammunition were found after the rampage in a black bag discovered in a dry river bed in Loughner's neighborhood. In addition, authorities said Wednesday that the gunman apparently fired 32 shots, one more than previously thought. A woman found a bullet casing in her purse several days later, Kastigar said. \"A woman who was around the shooting scene that day found the casing and reported it to police,\" he said. \"It fits right into our investigation. We always knew Loughner had one round in his chamber and 31 in the magazine.\" Kastigar said he didn't know whether the woman attended the event at the Safeway, was a passerby or was coming out of the store at the time of the shooting. Gloria Giffords writes that her daughter shows improvement every day \"and shows higher levels of comprehension and complex actions. \"Yesterday, when Mark came back from speaking at her aide's memorial service, she reached up and untied his tie and undid the top button to his shirt,\" according to the e-mail. \"Last night, she took his iPod and scrolled through all the pictures. Early this morning she began to read cards made for her by some 4th graders! Her unbandaged eye tracked the lines, she opened the cards and turned them over reading the back. Mark's gotten pages of large print of Harry Potter's 1st book for her to hold and read.\" The e-mail also says that Giffords gave her husband \"a 20-minute neck and back rub.\" Giffords remains in serious condition. A second, unnamed victim is listed in good condition. Kelly told the affiliate the couple had been concerned about heated and divisive political debates, but despite the fears, Giffords' passion for public service was a priority. \"She was doing what she loved, she was representing the people of southern Arizona,\" Kelly said. \"She felt it was very important for them to have the opportunity to walk up to her and tell her what they think.\" Kelly said the lawmaker will resume her public service \"stronger than ever\" as soon as she's well enough. He predicted she would return to the scene of the shooting. \"She loves southern Arizona more than anything,\" he told CNN affiliate KGUN. \"She's here every week, doing stuff like 'Congress on your Corner,' and I'm sure the first thing she's gonna do, when she's ready, is a 'Congress on your Corner' at that Safeway\" where the shooting occurred. The outpouring of support has been tremendous, Kelly said, including an elementary school student who sent his $2.85 in lunch money to Giffords with a card. \"I sealed it back up, and we're gonna give it back to him,\" Kelly said. \"It almost made me cry just standing there in the room, just to see the kid put his lunch money in the envelope for her.\"' Gloria Giffords wrote in the e-mail that her daughter has hard work ahead of her. She has been moving her limbs on command, according to the e-mail, and doctors have had her sitting up in a chair. \"So now comes the 'true grit' part,\" she wrote, \"and (it) won't be a stroll in a park although Mark predicts she'll be up and walking around in 2 weeks. The physical and emotional therapy will proceed side by side and it'll be stringent.\" Giffords has not been able to speak because of a breathing tube in her throat. Her mother wrote that Giffords will continue communicating more as she becomes more alert and will speak after the tube comes out. \"You notice I'm speaking in the present tense ... because that's where all your future prayers are going to come in,\" she wrote. The e-mail said Giffords' parents are \"humbled by the outpouring of love and prayers and overwhelmed with gratitude.\" The hospital's front lawn and the perimeter of Giffords' Tucson office are \"illuminated by thousands of candles, get-well placards, hers and the other victims' photos, prayers, stuffed animals and people.\" Surveillance video of the January 8 shooting shows Loughner walking up to Giffords and firing at her face from 24 to 36 inches away, Kastigar, told CNN. Kastigar said he viewed the surveillance video the day of the incident, and the hard drives have been turned over to the FBI. He said its contents have not been previously discussed for a variety of reasons, chief among them protecting the victims' families from the graphic details it contains. On the video, the suspect can be clearly seen walking around a table and up to Giffords, pointing a gun at her face and pulling the trigger. Giffords is barely in the frame of the video, he said. The gunman then turns to his left and walks out of the video, when witnesses said he began firing indiscriminately at others. U.S. District Judge John Roll can be seen on the video putting his arms over Giffords staffer Ron Barber and attempting to push him down and crawl under the table with him, Kastigar said. In trying to help Barber, Roll exposes his back to the gunman and is shot. Roll died; Barber was also shot, but survived. \"I have to detach my personal feelings\" about the video as an investigator, but the video offers investigators a way to sort out sometimes confusing or conflicting witness statements about what took place, Kastigar said. It also clarified that the gunman's intended target was Giffords, as it made clear that he walked up and fired the first round at her, Kastigar said. A law enforcement official said federal and local authorities have conducted more than 300 interviews as part of the investigation. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Roni Selig contributed to this report .",

        "input": "If there was a musician who transcended the difficult boundaries between East and West, it was sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. Panditji, as he was known to his fans, did it by remaining true to his craft.\"He was an amazingly pure artist,\" says Kartik Seshadri, one of Shankar's pupils and a sitar master in his own right. Though he's often thought of in the West as an experimenter and collaborator -- with guitarist George Harrison, violinist Yehudi Menuhin, saxophonist John Coltrane, composer Phillip Glass and conductor Andre Previn -- Shankar was a traditionalist. Indian classical music, as ancient as the scriptures of Hinduism, flowed from his fingers with ease. His music transfixed even those who knew not one iota about the complexities of it. \"That is the beauty of his approach to music and how he was able to transfer that and translate that to an audience in the West,\" Seshadri says. Shankar's music moved from introspective to playful. \"There's a whole gamut of emotions that finds a place with people,\" Seshadri says. Shankar died Tuesday in San Diego, his home for many years. He was 92 and led a life rich with accomplishments and accolades. I was one of those people who was transfixed the first time I listened to Shankar. I was still in high school in Tallahassee, Florida, when Shankar and his troupe came to town for a performance at Florida State University's music school in December, 1978. There were only a handful of Indian families in Tallahassee then, and not much was available to us in the way of homeland culture. It was a rare treat for us to be able to see Shankar in concert. My mother was especially excited. She was trained in voice and sang the songs of another talented Indian, Rabindranath Tagore, India's sole Nobel laureate in literature. She played harmonium with her songs and sometimes, a tanpura, a string instrument that resembles a sitar but has no frets. It was a moment of pride, as well -- in a time when India was known to many of my American friends as a land of human misery. When we wanted to boast of the greatness of our land, we uttered Shankar's name. A few days before the concert, organizers called my mother with a special request: Could she possibly cook dinner for the musicians? Shankar was craving a home-cooked Bengali meal. Of course, yes, my mother said. Who would not be honored to cook for the maestro?Then came days of cooking -- spiced rice pilau with raisins and pistachios, chicken curry, lentils and sandesh, a special milk sweet for which Bengalis are famous. On the night of the performance, Opperman Music Hall was packed. The lights dimmed and Shankar's music filled the air, mellifluous and luscious like the rich silk of a Benarasi sari. Opinion: Ravi Shankar, emissary for world beat . I didn't understand the melodic forms and rhythms of the music that was played that night. I knew that he had written the music for director Satyajit Ray's acclaimed \"Apu Trilogy.\" But I was not unlike millions of others who connected Ravi Shankar's name to the Beatles and to the concert for Bangladesh. I had expected to react in typical teenage fashion with boredom. Instead, I was transported to another sphere. Shankar's sitar was magical. The rhythms of the performance fell and rose with the improvisation of each melody framework known as a raga. His sitar told of joy and sorrow, of lives led and dreams dashed. The intensity on stage rose as Shankar challenged tabla virtuoso Alla Rakha to match each one of his sitar riffs. I did not just hear a performance that night. I felt it. Later that evening Shankar and Rakha arrived at our house. I sat in awe through every course of my mother's dinner. It was my introduction to the classical music of my homeland. I realized then that I didn't need to understand the nuances of the notes. Shankar spoke to me in a language that was universal. \"He created an aura of spirituality,\" says journalist and musician Partha Banerjee. \"His music transcends the boundaries of race and religion. It is what humanity is all about.\"Harrison dubbed Shankar the \"godfather of world music.\" Many Indians like to think of him as their cultural ambassador to the world. Had he been born a Westerner, he might have been a household name like Beethoven or Mozart, Banerjee believes. In later years, Shankar said he was happy to have contributed to bringing the music of India to the West, though he regretted his name forever linked to a 1960s culture of drugs, sex and rock 'n' roll. The music he played, he said, was sacred. Hallowed, even. Not many ordinary Indians I know would eject their Bollywood CDs to listen to Shankar's sitar. He's not on top-40 lists. But Ravi Shankar's gift went beyond his skills on the strings. He possessed an uncommon ability to reach across cultures. He introduced the traditions of my homeland to my friends in America. And he did it by touching their souls. Photos: People we lost in 2012 .",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Everyone knows Hong Kong as the buzzy island city home to over seven million people perpetually on the move. But it may be a surprise to learn that many of the residents in this bustling city don't spend much time foraging in their pockets for change, especially on public transport. Instead, they whip out their Octopus, a contactless smart card with a chip that communicates with a fare processor in less than a second. It has been in use in Hong Kong since 1997. According to the company, around 95 percent of people in Hong Kong between the ages of 16-65 have an Octopus card, and their transactions add up to about 18 million dollars every day. But what's new about Octopus is that recent advances in technology mean that it's being used with phones too. \"Now with the advance of smart card technology, we've been able to embed the Octopus mobile SIM inside a smartphone,\" explained Octopus CEO Kevin Goldmintz, in an interview with CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. Trains, buses, trams and ferries are all popular places to get around with Octopus, whether it's on a card, a phone or a watch. Since the Octopus card was released nearly two decades ago, its use has branched off into much more than just transport. Forgot your wallet, purse or cash? Not to worry. The Octopus can buy your coffee, a movie ticket, clothes, groceries and even allow you to shop online. Another new venture is that Octopus has recently partnered with Taobao, China's e-commerce answer to eBay or Amazon. Though purchases have to remain relatively small with a current ceiling of $130 on each card, Octopus says it allows the customer to easily interact for a purchase. Shoppers simply need to make a purchase on Taobao by putting their phone with the Octopus mobile application up to the screen and tapping to make that transaction happen. Octopus has broadened its reach into mainland China with a dual card in Guangdong province and another in Shenzhen. \"We're able to put a Hong Kong dollar purse inside the card, as an e-wallet,\" said Goldmintz. Octopus says its vision for the next ten years includes tackling the physical/digital convergence and growing its e-commerce strategy. \"And I think the other side of it will also to be exporting the knowledge that we've accumulated over 17 years of doing contactless smart card, and deploying that knowledge in other cities around the world,\" Goldmintz told Stout. As for the future, Octopus is optimistic that a cashless society will spread to other areas, particularly in its own patch of the Asia-Pacific area. \"You know I buy my lunch with my Octopus. I pay for drinks on Octopus. I buy coffee with my Octopus,\" said Goldmintz. \"So I think there will be day when both Hong Kong and other cities around Asia-Pacific particularly will be looking towards a cashless society,\" he said. \"I think we're going to make huge in-roads in the next five to ten years in this.\" The best way to experience Hong Kong? Climb aboard one of its iconic trams .",
        "output": "Hong Kong residents have a fairly cash-free life, especially on public transport .\nThe Octopus card, already 17 years old, is now used for several types of commerce .\nOctopus sees a cashless society as a reality, especially in the Asia-Pacific region ."

        "input": "ISIS has used videos of its shocking beheadings of Western hostages to seize the world's attention, threatening the United States and its allies. But the Islamic militant group is also pushing its extremist views in a slick online magazine. The publication -- named \"Dabiq\" after a town in northern Syria that symbolizes a clash between Islam and the West -- portrays U.S. President Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain as \"crusaders\" who will \"bring about the complete collapse of the modern American empire.\" It also carries images evoking apocalyptic battles between the Sunni extremist group's fighters and the rest of the world -- including American soldiers enveloped in flames. By producing the magazine, ISIS is taking a leaf out of the book of its former ally al Qaeda, which has praised and advocated terrorist attacks in its glossy publication, Inspire. But experts say the two terrorist groups don't appear to be aiming for the same goals through their propaganda. Inspire focuses more on practical advice for terrorists planning attacks, publishing guides on how to make bombs and get them onto planes. Dabiq \"is very different,\" Seth Jones, a security analyst at the RAND Corporation, told CNN. \"This is encouraging people to come, to recruit and to join the army in Iraq and Syria -- and fight.\" 'A global outreach strategy' ISIS has already been exploiting the brutal tactics it used to grab control of large areas of Syria and Iraq for publicity purposes. The publication of Dabiq demonstrates that ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, is \"looking not only to nearby areas for support, but is undertaking a global outreach strategy to recruit immigrants to build its state,\" the Institute for the Study of War said in a recent report. It noted \"the sophistication and production value of the magazine.\" ISIS has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe, including from the United States and Western Europe. A CIA source told CNN last week that more than 15,000 foreign fighters, including 2,000 Westerners, have gone to the civil war in Syria. It was not immediately clear how many have joined ISIS and how many are with other groups opposed to the Syrian government. The foreign fighters come from more than 80 countries, the CIA source said. Article on Foley's beheading . Dabiq carries plenty of violent images, apparently aimed at luring jihadists. It has photos of the mutilated bodies of Muslims wounded and killed by Western forces and their allies -- but also pictures of ISIS's own victims. The final section of its most recent issue is dedicated to the beheading of American journalist James Foley, the first of three Western captives whose killings the group has publicized. The article defends his murder as retribution for Western military campaigns in the Middle East. The magazine shows that ISIS, which is also known as ISIL, is paying close attention to what's being said about it in the West, featuring an \"In the Words of the Enemy\" section. In the first issue, it focuses on an article co-written by Douglas Ollivant, an Iraq combat veteran and key adviser on the surge in U.S. troops there under former President George W. Bush in 2007. Ollivant, who appears regularly on CNN, is also described as a \"crusader.\" He said he was \"perversely honored\" that the terrorists were reading his work, but was also aware he was being \"incorporated into their propaganda.\" \"We take them seriously, write about them seriously, and perversely they then twist this to their potential recruits and say 'Look, you know, American analysts take us seriously,'\" Ollivant told CNN.

        "input": "Paris (CNN) -- This is a country which says races don't exist: there is only the human race, to which we all belong. This is a country which, unlike the U.S. and Britain, has purposefully limited freedom of speech in order to criminalize verbal violence and incitement to hatred in all its forms. But this is also a country where the black justice minister Christiane Taubira is welcomed by a child with the words \"Hey, guenon [monkey], go and eat bananas!\" The 12-year-old girl who uttered those words in the town of Angers on October 25 had come with her parents to protest against the same-sex marriage law of which the minister has become a symbol. In the crowd of protesters were a dozen children shouting the word guenon; their parents looked pleased, proud even. And we thought, naively, and rather condescendingly, that this sort of racist abuse could only be found in a country like Italy, ethnically less diverse than France. We all remembered Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi repeatedly describing U.S. President Barack Obama as \"really much tanned\". We all remembered, earlier this year, Congo-born Cecile Kyenge, Italy's first ever black minister, having bananas thrown at her. Italian senator Roberto Calderoli even referred to her as \"having the features of an orangutan.\" We thought such coarse xenophobia could not take place here. No, surely not in France! How wrong we were. It actually took many of us by surprise. The fact that parents asked their children to hurl racist abuse at a government minister added to the sense of shock. As explained in a timelime in French weekly L'Express', it actually took days for the French political class to react to the racist insults endured by Taubira. Why such dithering? Some were embarrassed; others feared they might exacerbate the current tension in France if they made too big a fuss. The same sex marriage legal battle which raged on last year seems to have reopened a box we thought long shut: France has witnessed the resurgence of a far-right alliance between traditionalist Catholics and ultra-conservatives who suddenly see themselves as the new revolutionaries. At night, they dream of insurrection. It has sometimes felt like being thrown back in time, to the 1930s. On November 13, however, Minute, an extreme-right publication which ran the monkey analogy on its front page, was formally investigated for racism, and Interior Minister Manuel Valls said he was looking at blocking the distribution of the magazine. \"We cannot let this pass,\" he said. \"This is not just Christiane Taubira who has been attacked for her color. It is the Republic, it is France and its values that are under attack.\" For the Paris-based Moroccan poet and writer Tahar Ben Jelloun, in an open letter called \"Racism, the ultimate temptation\" and published in the Italian daily La Repubblica on November 15: \"Everywhere in Europe, we see the resurgence of racism. It may only be words but it could end with the gas chambers.\" According to Jelloun, France is no more racist than its neighbors but the real problem is that, today, racism finds an ideal breeding ground on social networks where anonymity unleashes unrestrained violence. In a famous recent case, the French justice system, often harsher on verbal violence than many other countries, has tried to stop Twitter from serving as a platform for all kinds of xenophobic abuses presented as \"jokes.\" In October 2012, racist hashtags in French such as #IfMyDaughterComesHomeWithABlack or #AGoodJew unleashed the worse examples of unrestrained racism. In France, racial insults in public are punishable by up to six months in jail and fines of up to â‚¬25,000; French justice was determined to sanction the xenophobic twitterati. At first, Twitter told the French justice it could not reveal its users' identities and would only obey the laws of California where it was based. But French judges argued -- successfully -- that the targeted public and the racist perpetrators were French-speakers operating from France. Twitter eventually complied to reveal the identity of those who had generated racist tweets so they could be prosecuted in France: A victory. French judges should now turn their attention to the French parents who teach their children to shout racist insults at a government minister born in French Guyana. Punitive sentences would be welcome. As would the end of anonymity on social networks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Agnes Poirier.",

        "input": "Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Getting heard and understood in Westlands, Nairobi, on a typical Saturday afternoon is a challenge. You would have to compete with noise from the constant traffic, the shouts of the road side vendors, music from matatus -- Kenya's colorful (and loud) public transport minibuses. On the afternoon of Saturday 21 September 2013 you would have had to compete with the additional noise of gunshots and grenades as a group of ruthless and well-drilled militants launched a brutal attack on the Westgate Shopping Center at the heart of Westlands. At least 61 civilians and six Kenyan security officers died in the attack and rescue efforts, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Tuesday. Information on the attack on Westgate was first broken on social media as those in the mall and its environs flooded their Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts with text and images. The amount of information being generated quickly turned into a flood as more and more people started posting or sharing information that was previously posted. Just like on the streets of Westlands on a busy Saturday afternoon, getting heard on the streets of Kenya's social media was a big challenge. What does attack mean for Kenyan security? This is not surprising. Kenyans increasingly go online to share and look for information. Information on the large fire at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi on August 7 first broke on social media. Social media was one of the key sources of information for Uchaguzi, the citizen centered election monitoring website that was deployed for the Kenyan general election in March. Previously Kenyans have used Twitter to organize carpooling during a strike by public transport operators by sharing information using the hashtag #carpoolKE and even to find out which petrol stations had stocks of fuel during fuel shortages using the hashtag #findfuel. Ordinary Kenyan citizens have learned how to use social media and other digital tools to amplify their voices in order to have impact. Research by Portland and Tweetminster in 2011 found Kenya as Africa's second most active country on Twitter after South Africa. What is new is the increasing presence of official Kenyan government accounts on social media. President Kenyatta's election campaign invested heavily in its social media and digital communication, and this has continued in government. Kenya's top security decision making body, the National Security Council, includes the President, Deputy President, Attorney General, and the cabinet secretaries for Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Interior and Co-ordination of National Government, many of whom tweet regularly. At security agency level, the Ministry of the Interior and Coordination of National Government, the Kenya Defense Forces, the Kenya Police Service, Kenya's National Disaster Operations Center, Kenya's National Steering Committee on Peacebuilding and Conflict Management all have active and regularly updated accounts on Twitter. During the Westgate crisis these accounts have been updated with official government information on operations and casualties. Questions linger after Nairobi mall attack . At Ushahidi we constantly remind people that technology is a tool not a solution. Just as a hammer can been used for positive or negative actions social media is also a tool that can be widely exploited across the board. Al-Shabaab is very effective in the use of social media and other digital tools in getting its messaging across. Since Saturday when the attacks began Twitter has already shut down at least one account connected to Al-Shabaab, which may have been in direct contact with the militants inside Westgate. Having a presence on social media itself presents challenges for officials especially when it comes to the authenticity of the social media accounts. The Kenya Police Service for example has a long-running parody unofficial Twitter account. During the Westgate crisis several of the official Kenyan government Twitter accounts were verified, a process which establishes their authenticity and allows them to display a badge which identifies them publicly as official channels of communication. Now that the government's Twitter accounts have been identified as authentic the next challenge is to keep them relevant with useful information. Tweets from government urging Kenyans to hug each other during the height of the crisis were ill timed as the country waited to hear the fate of the hostages still held inside the shopping mall. Building credibility online, just like building credibility offline, takes time. On this the Kenyan government should learn from the digital media team at Kenya Red Cross. The Kenya Red Cross ran the most credible, useful and respected Twitter account during the entire Westgate crisis. The Kenya Red Cross is a pioneer in how social media can be used to crowdsource information online that first responders can use. Through its #iVolunteer hashtag Kenya Red Cross encourages all Kenyans to report incidents in which first responders are required and the Kenya Red Cross follow up these reports dispatching ambulances as required. What threat do foreign jihadists pose? Through its social media accounts the Kenya Red Cross was able to keep large groups of people updated on the Westgate crisis as it unfolded, was able to source information on where help was required inside and outside Westgate. In addition the Kenya Red Cross digital media team helped coordinate and publicize what was described as the largest blood drive in Kenya's history. About 6,380 units of blood were donated across the country in around 48 hours following the attack. In another record-breaking social media led campaign the Kenya Red Cross partnered with Safaricom, Kenya's largest mobile phone network, to launch a fundraising drive using Safaricom's M-pesa mobile money platform. As of 2pm EAT on 25th September, 76 hours after its launch, Safaricom reported that the #WeAreOne campaign had raised $783,485 in donations made largely by individual Kenyans. This is the latest in a series of successful partnerships between Kenya Red Cross and Safaricom who also partnered in 2011 to lead the Kenyans For Kenya campaign which raised around $11.5 million in four weeks for Kenyans facing severe famine. All these initiatives contribute to the continuing adoption and growth in popularity of social media across the region. Being able to quickly and accurately filter large volumes of data to identify which pieces of information are useful in your particular incident is a global challenge that Ushahidi is working to address by building a coalition and tools for a clearinghouse for crisis data. This we believe will lead to more effective online information management such as using citizens to triangulate each other's information, which in turn gives first responders data on which they can act on immediately. Once we have this, ordinary citizens using social media would become a much more effective tool in time of crisis, altering today's communication flows.

Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel, I took a shot at him and he jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still,\" the note reads, according to Bivens. CNN first reported on the handwritten notes on Monday. Frein, 31, is suspected in the September 12 ambush that left Cpl. Bryon Dickson dead and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove. Bivens said Frein faces two additional counts of possession of a weapon of mass destruction after two booby trapped pipe bombs were discovered in the Pocono Mountains search area last week. Authorities said a search of Frein's bedroom turned up a variety of black and synthetic powders -- material consistent with what was used to make the two pipe bombs. In the search of his bedroom, investigators also found galvanized steel pipes drilled out to accept fusing material, end caps, pyrotechnic fuse and improvised explosive initiators. \"The design is simple but very dangerous and could have caused significant injury to anyone in the vicinity of that explosive,\" said Sam Rabadi, special agent in charge of ATF in Pennsylvania. Who is Eric Frein? Bivens said the handwritten notes were discovered among items left behind at a campsite located by law enforcement agents on September 29. After the shooting, Frein supposedly wrote, \"I ran back to the jeep. I made maybe half a mile ... and hit a road block. I didn't expect one so soon. It was only 15 to 20 minutes.\" Bivens quoted the suspect as writing that he \"did a k turn a quarter mile from them and pulled into a development I knew had unfinished access road. Hearing helos, I just used my marker lights, missed the trail around a runoff pool and drove straight into it. Disaster. Made half attempt to stash AK and ran.\" A massive search for Frein has been carried out since, at times involving as many as 1,000 officers. Despite recent sightings and other leads, he has eluded authorities. The manhunt has cost several million dollars, Bivens said. Authorities have said that a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein shows that he had planned the attack for years. Frein has been described as a survivalist and military reenactment enthusiast with a hatred for law enforcement, authorities say. CNN's David Shortell and Steve Kastenbaum contributed to this report.",

        "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe has shown throughout her career that when it comes to voting, it's her principles and constituents that guide her, not her party. Sen. Olympia Snowe has received overwhelming support from her constituents in past elections. Those principles, analysts note, are guiding her to find a compromise on health care reform currently stalemated in Congress. Jennifer Duffy, who follows the Senate for the Cook Political Report, said Snowe's independent streak is \"not new behavior for her.\" \"I think they [Republicans] also realize that the only reason that the state of Maine has two Republican senators at all is the fact that they are very independent-minded and they vote their state,\" she said, referring to Snowe and Sen. Susan Collins. In fact, some estimates place Snowe as having voted with her party only 57 percent of the time in the current Congress. While her moderate views are at odds with GOP opposition to several of President Obama's economic plans this year, the senator's constituents seem to agree with her. In 2006, she won re-election with 74 percent of the vote, compared to her Democratic opponent's 21 percent. In 2000, Snowe received 69 percent of the vote. In an interview with National Public Radio in 2006, she said that while her views are moderate, Maine, like other New England states, has been \"naturally independent\" \"Oftentimes, I tell my leadership, don't blame me, it's just where I grew up,\" she said at the time. Snowe, 59, was elected to Congress in 1978 at age 31, and served Maine's 2nd District for 16 years. She ran for Senate in 1994 and won, \"becoming the first woman in American history to serve in both houses of the state legislature and both houses of Congress,\" her Senate Web site notes. Her political career began in 1973 after her husband, Maine Rep. Peter Snowe, was killed in a car accident and she was elected to fill his seat. After two years in the state Senate, she won the U.S. House seat held by William Cohen when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1978. Snowe was elected to the Senate with 60 percent of the vote during the Republican revolution of 1994, filling the seat of longtime Democratic Sen. George Mitchell, who retired. She married then-Maine Gov. John McKernan in 1989. In 2006, Time Magazine named her one of the top 10 U.S. senators, calling her \"the caretaker.\" \"Because of her centrist views and eagerness to get beyond partisan point scoring, Maine Republican Olympia Snowe is in the center of every policy debate in Washington,\" the article read. \"But while Snowe is a major player on national issues, she is also known as one of the most effective advocates for her constituents.\" Duffy said that if Snowe and Collins started voting with the Republican leadership all the time, \"They would probably both lose re-election.\" Part of the so-called \"Gang of Six\" on the Senate Finance Committee, which includes three Democrats and three Republicans, she has been actively negotiating with the White House. The White House said that Sens. Chuck Grassley and Mike Enzi, the other two Republicans in the Gang of Six, have backed away from negotiations, although Enzi released a statement that said he is still willing to talk. Snowe said it's important to work with the other party despite criticism. \"I think sometimes, yes, I'd find myself in that position, you know, with fewer and fewer ... people who are willing to reach across the political aisle and to create what I ... call the sensible center,\" she told NPR last week. \"I mean, that's where the majority of Americans are. And I try to sort of build those ... bridges.\" Part of that bridge building was seen with her votes for the president's $787 billion economic stimulus package in February. For the past months, Snowe has been pushing the idea of a safety net plan, or \"trigger,\" for a public health care option as part of a key compromise. A source familiar with her negotiations with Obama said that's one of the things they're talking about.  Watch more on the health care debate » . The idea would give insurance companies a defined period to make changes in order to help cover more people and drive down long-term costs. But if those changes failed to occur within the defined period, a trigger would provide for creating a public option to force change on the insurance companies. \"This option would be available from day one in any state where -- after market and insurance reforms are implemented -- affordable, competitive plans still do not exist,\" she said in a press release. Her main concerns so far have been the high cost of health care proposals. \"What we have to do is develop a plan that's going to be available to people on an affordable basis, and, secondly, containing costs both for the American consumer and the American taxpayer,\" Snowe said in the NPR interview last week. Cost has been a major part of her bipartisan efforts in the Senate. \"Given the gravity of our economic circumstances, I am pleased that our bipartisan negotiations have yielded a consensus solution that will create jobs, assist the displaced and invest in our economy,\" she said at the time about the stimulus plan. She added that it is not a \"matter of labeling something as spending or as tax relief; it's finding and including in this package the vital provisions necessary for jump-starting our economy.\" CNN's Dana Bash, Ed Henry and Mark Preston contributed to this report.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Microsoft is taking its last big step before releasing what promises to be a massive overhaul of its Windows operating system -- and, by extension, how almost all devices running it work. Nearing the end of a long process of tinkering under the hood, the computing giant on Friday rolled out its final preview of Windows 8, which is expected to go on sale this fall. \"Since our first preview release last September, millions of people now use the pre-release product on a daily basis and millions more have been taking it through its paces, totaling hundreds of millions of hours of testing,\" Microsoft's Steven Sinofsky wrote Friday on the Windows 8 blog. \"We genuinely appreciate the effort that so many have put into pre-release testing, and of course, we appreciate the feedback too. Direct feedback and feedback through usage contributed to hundreds of visible changes in the product and tens of thousands of under-the-hood changes.\" The post said Microsoft has received about 18,000 comments from 7,000 early testers of Windows 8, which have contributed to \"hundreds of visible changes in the product and tens of thousands of under-the-hood changes.\" The release will mark the first major update of Microsoft's operating system since Windows 7 was released three years ago. Unlike previous releases that have, essentially, revamped (or, in at least one case, mercifully killed) existing features, Microsoft is touting Windows 8 as a radical reimagining of its core product. Perhaps its most visible difference from previous versions of Windows will be its compatibility with touchscreen technology. That, combined with the system's ability to connect devices (say, a PC, a tablet and a Xbox gaming console) is what Microsoft hopes will renew the enduring Mac vs. PC war on a new front. \"In our hands-on of Microsoft's Consumer Preview, we declared that your familiar Windows desktop is all but dead,\" Alexandra Chang wrote Friday for Wired. \"In the changes we've seen in the Release Preview, this still holds true,\" she added. \"Microsoft is focused on improving and deepening the Metro [the system's design language] experience, where the desktop is only a portion -- or even an afterthought, for some users -- of a larger, app-based system.\" The company has made something of a ripple with its smartphone system, at least among critics. The recently released Nokia Lumia 900 has been heralded as the best Windows phone ever, although, as of March, only about 4% of U.S. smartphones ran the company's operating system. (For what it's worth, that's a month before the Lumia was released.) But Microsoft has barely moved the needle in the tablet space, where Apple still rules the roost, and only a simpler and less expensive device like Amazon's Kindle Fire has been able to put up much resistance. Even as the final Windows 8 trial was being announced, reports were surfacing that Asus, Toshiba and Acer all plan to unveil Windows tablets next week at the Computex trade show in Taipei. Meanwhile, many in the tech world are watching and waiting. With its prowess in the computing world, it's impossible to count Microsoft out. But with Apple and Google's Android system grabbing the attention and market share in the mobile world, Microsoft appears to have an uphill battle. \"There's a long, narrow road ahead for Windows 8,\" reviewer Seth Rosenblatt wrote for CNET. \"It could be the next big thing, but there's not much room for missteps.\"",
        "output": "Microsoft rolls out its final preview version of Windows 8 .\nThe operating system is a massive overhaul of Windows .\nIt's considered the company's way of moving into the tablet market .\nWindows 8 also will connect PCs, tablets and phones ."

        "input": "(CNN) -- One man's trash is another man's treasure. Admittedly, it helps if the trash comes from one of the most famous billionaire businessmen on the planet. When Richard Branson zipped across the Atlantic in the record-breaking time of three days, eight hours and 31 minutes, in 1986, his magnificent powerboat was held up as the cutting edge of design. But almost 30 years later, the $2.3 million Atlantic Virgin Challenger II which captured our imaginations, had been left to rot in a remote Spanish boatyard. Until now. A British boat builder -- who as a teenager watched Branson thump across the waves in style -- has rescued the iconic powerboat from the scrapyard in an ambitious plan to restore her to former glory. \"She looked so sorry for herself, tucked away in this boatyard, surrounded by numerous other boats rotting away in a type of nautical graveyard,\" said boat builder and new owner, Dan Stevens. \"It was such an amazing boat and an amazing achievement -- a piece of maritime history. We want to restore her and bring her back to the UK where she belongs.\" Branson himself has backed the ambitious project, tweeting: \"So many memories on Virgin Atlantic Challenger II, would be great to see it back on the ocean.\" Indeed, footage of a young Branson speeding from New York to Britain's Isle of Scilly in a sleek 22-meter powerboat, epitomized the technological spirit of the era. After all, this was 1986: IBM had just unveiled its first laptop, the Soviet Union was launching the Mir Space Station and Tom Cruise kept daring us to fly ever higher in the hit film \"Top Gun\". Yet peer inside Challenger II today, and you'll find a sagging, faded 1980s time warp. \"It's like stepping back in time,\" Stevens said of the boat which had notched up just 800 hours on the clock. \"It still has all the Virgin livery, original charts, electronics and seats.\" \"It's amazing just looking out the window -- a bit like sitting in the front seat in Knight Rider,\" he added, referring to the 1982 TV series starring David Hasselhoff and a sci-fi car. After smashing the record books, Virgin Atlantic Challenger II is believed to have been sold to a Saudi Arabian sultan, whose faded coat of arms still adorns the boat. In 2005 it was sold again to a secret owner who \"kept it in the Mediterranean but rarely used it,\" said Stevens. \"The boat was towed into Palma where she started to degrade quite quickly.\" Work is now underway repairing the vessel which had been left languishing in a boatyard for the last eight years, with plans to test her on the open seas next month. Challenger II will have a new engine, fuel tank, electronic equipment and interior -- all in keeping with the original style. Once complete, the legendary vessel will travel 2,400 kilometers to Stevens' boat building business, Seahawks Workboats in south west England, with plans to tour her across the country. The vessel had been advertised for $380,000, though Stevens declined to say how much he paid for it. \"She could have very easily been set for the scrapyard,\" he said. \"Many people had seen her, but I think a lot had been scared off by the amount of work needed.\" Challenger II may have cemented her place in maritime history, but it wasn't all smooth sailing for the record-breaking Atlantic crossing. Branson's first attempt at the Blue Riband Transatlantic Challenge -- the award for the fastest crossing of the ocean -- ended in disaster in 1985 when Virgin Atlantic Challenger I sunk off the south west coast of England. Unfortunately for Branson, he was denied the Blue Riband after breaking two rules of the competition - stopping to refuel and using a vessel which did not have a commercial maritime purpose. Regardless, he was showered in champagne greeted by cheering crowds upon arrival in Britain -- despite the pouring rain. Today, Challenger II may be a little worse for wear. But much like that other 1980s icon, film Back to the Future, Stevens may soon turn back the clock on the legendary power boat.",

So while he managed to take his career goals tally to 400 with a double in Real Madrid's 3-0 win over Celta Vigo Monday, it's rather ironic that he has never scored in the seventh minute of a professional football match. In fact, Ronaldo has registered in every single minute of a football match throughout his career -- but never in the seventh. Ronaldo, who brought up the landmark in his 653rd match for club and country, has scored 230 goals for Real, 118 for Manchester United, five for Sporting Lisbon and 47 for Portugal. The 28-year-old has scored against 109 different teams, in 87 different stadiums with 332 goals coming from inside the penalty area. Real's victory in its first game back since the winter break, came courtesy Ronaldo's double and an opening strike from Karim Benzema. Ronaldo dedicated his goals to fellow countryman Eusebio -- one of Portugal's greatest players, who passed away at the age of 71 on Sunday. Real, which has played 18 games, sits third, five points behind leaders Barcelona and city rival Atletico. \"It was not a good performance and we need to learn how to be tighter at the back,\" Real coach Carlo Ancelotti told a news conference. \"We lacked balance as we had a lot of players going forward and were open to the counter-attack. \"Celta defended deeply and it wasn't easy but we should have been more balanced when we pressed.\" Arsenal . In England, Arsenal star Theo Walcott has been ruled out for up to six months after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The winger, who suffered the blow during the 2-0 FA Cup win over fierce rival Tottenham on Saturday, is also a huge doubt for the World Cup. In a statement on its website, Arsenal said: \"After coming off injured in Saturday's 2-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur, the Club regrettably announces that Theo Walcott has sustained a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee. \"Theo will have surgery in London in the near future and is expected to be out for at least six months, therefore missing the remainder of the season and the World Cup in Brazil in the summer. \"Everyone at Arsenal wishes Theo a speedy recovery and we look forward to seeing him back on a football pitch as soon as possible.\" The England star faces a race against time to be ready for the World Cup with his country's first game set to take place against Italy on June 14. Walcott, who has scored five times in 36 appearances at international level, made his debut at the age of 17 in 2006. Rossi . Meanwhile, Italy's top scorer Giuseppe Rossi could miss up to three months of the season after being forced to undergo surgery on his knee. Rossi, who lost two years of his career after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury and required two operations, will visit U.S. surgeon Richard Steadman for treatment. Fiorentina said Rossi picked up a second degree sprain to the medial collateral ligament during the 1-0 victory over Livorno on Sunday. Rossi, who has scored 14 goals this season, limped out of the action following a poor tackle from Leandro Rinaudo. \"For a correct valuation of the extent of the damage and the outlook, a visit to a specialist will take place in the next few days,\" Fiorentina said in a statement. On the pitch, Kaka inspired AC Milan to a 3-0 win over Atalanta in Serie A with his 100th goal for the club in all competitions. He added a second after the break and 18-year-old Bryan Cristante netted a third on his full debut. Milan manager, Massimiliano Allegri, who confirmed on Christmas Day that he will be leaving at the end of the season, told reporters he was delighted with Kaka's performance. Milan . \"Kaka played excellent football working for the team and scoring twice,\" Allegri said. \"I'm very happy for him and the objective that he's reached. \"We all need to be focused on ending the season in the best way that we can and aware that we still have a long way yet to go.\" Elsewhere, Miroslav Klose's stunning strike gave Lazio a 1-0 win over Inter Milan to hand new manager Edoardo Reja a winning start to his second spell in charge. Reja, who left the club 18 months ago, returned to Lazio after Vladimir Petkovic was sacked following the news that he was set to take over as Switzerland coach. Napoli sit third in the table following a 2-0 win over Sampdoria thanks to a brace from Dries Mertens. Verona moved into fifth place with a 3-1 win at Udinese with Luca Toni scoring twice, while Parma came from behind to defeat Torino 3-1 in a hard-fought contest.

Myanmar's turnaround from pariah state to becoming this year's must-see destination has been remarkable. Much of the country is untouched and rich in both historic and architectural heritage. There is plenty to discover for the tourist who wants to go off the beaten track. Below CNN takes a look at some of Myanmar's most magnificent treasures. Shwedagon Pagoda . The golden stupa of Yangon's 2,500-year-old Shwedagon Pagoda shines over the city. The pagoda is covered in hundreds of golden plates and there are thousands of encrusted diamonds on the stupa, glittering in all different colors, reflecting the rays of the sun. It's a majestic site and impossible not to notice when visiting the former capital of Myanmar. \"In Myanmar, it is very important for our religion,\" says Kyaw, a guide at Shwedagon. \"Because most people from here, mostly Buddhist people, have to come here at least one time in their life.\" Myanmar is one of the world's most devout Buddhist nations -- the majority of Burmese are Buddhists and the 100-meter-tall Shwedagon is their most sacred temple. Legend says it enshrines eight of Buddha's hair, that were given to two merchant brothers by Buddha himself. At times the pagoda has also served as a rallying point and a source of strength against the former military regime, or as in the 1920s and 1930s resistance to British Colonial rule. Read more: 11 things to know before visiting Myanmar . Colonial architecture in Yangon . The architectural heritage of Yangon is rich and evidence of the former British Empire is almost at every corner. Buildings from the colonial era stretch out across the city, telling stories of a time long gone. Yangon has one of the highest number of colonial period buildings in all of south-east Asia, built during the British rule in Burma, which lasted from 1824 to 1948. Buildings like the City Hall, the former High Court and Strand Hotel attract many visitors. But these iconic buildings are under threat, since renovating and preserving their crumbling facades is costly. The Yangon Heritage Trust is trying to ensure these buildings don't meet a bulldozer, so the country's past can be maintained. One building in particular could be seen as the monument to Myanmar's political rebirth. The Secretariat, the Minister's building during the British rule, has been standing empty for years, but played an important role in the history of Myanmar. This is where the leaders of the independence movement in the late 1940s were assassinated -- among them General Aung San, the father of Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's Nobel laureate, and a former political prisoner. That her father lost his life in the assassination room is one of the reasons why the Secretariat could now be preserved. \"I think just a couple of years ago this was not on the agenda at all and I think we were in real danger,\" says chairman of the Yangon Heritage Trust, Thant Myint-U.

Traveling along the lifeblood of the country -- the river Irrawaddy -- feels like being on a trek back in time. Along the river there are fishing villages where life hasn't changed for decades. The cruise along the river gets you to places not so easily reached by car or rail. But there is one destination that leaves every visitor breathless -- Bagan. Bagan is an ancient city situated in central Myanmar, in the region of Mandalay.

Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of chief executive of News Corporation, the parent company of News International, personally apologized to Dowler's family in July amid allegations that News of the World journalists listened to voice-mail messages on the girl's phone while she was missing. \"As the founder of the company, I was appalled to find out what happened,\" Murdoch said after speaking with the family in July. Allegations that journalists hacked into the girl's voice-mail were part of a larger phone-hacking scandal that rocked Britain this year, prompting several arrests, resignations and hearings in Parliament. As part of the settlement, announced Friday by News International and the Dowler family, Murdoch will pay 1 million British pounds -- about $1.6 million -- to charities chosen by the Dowler family. Those charities \"represent causes close to Milly and those that provide support to other victims of crime,\" in a statement that News International and the Dowler family issued Friday. Milly Dowler was 13 when she disappeared. \"Nothing that has been agreed will ever bring back Milly or undo the traumas of her disappearance and the horrendous murder trial earlier this year,\" the Dowler family said in a statement. \"The only way that a fitting tribute could be agreed was to ensure that a very substantial donation to charity was made in Milly's memory. We hope that projects will be undertaken so that some good can come from this.\" Murdoch apologized again Friday for News of the World's actions. \"The behaviour that the News of the World exhibited towards the Dowlers was abhorrent and I hope this donation underscores my regret for the company's role in this awful event,\" he said in the statement. \"I also hope that through the personal donation something positive can be done in memory of their daughter.\"",

        "input": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The days are getting shorter, the nights colder, but that doesn't mean that your electricity bill needs to go through the roof. In a unique experiment, the residents of Britain's Scilly Isles are hoping to show that reducing your electricity consumption doesn't have to be difficult. The Isles of Scilly is switching off power to promote energy efficiency. As part of E-Day, homes, schools and businesses on the Scilly Isles are switching off all non-essential electrical equipment to promote energy saving. The results of the experiment are being posted online in real-time. E-Day organizer, Matt Prescott said: \"The Isles of Scilly are like a miner's canary for the rest of the UK, because of their vulnerability to sea level rise, to violent storms rolling off the Atlantic and to any major changes in the Gulf Stream.\" The islands, which lie 28 miles off Land's End, the UK's most westerly point, are connected to the UK mainland by a single electricity cable which means that power usage in the experiment can be measured efficiently. All of the 2000-strong community who are spread across five islands have been encouraged to join in. The energy savings made will be compared against the previous day's usage with updates appearing online regularly. The E-Day Web site keeps track of costs and kWh usage providing up-to-the-minute information about how much electricity is being used in island-wide as well as individually monitoring Five Islands School on St Mary's Island and the electricity consumption of one family. \"We've fitted the family and the school with special energy monitors so they can accurately monitor what appliances use the most electricity,\" Prescott told CNN. Studies suggest that families who use these sorts of energy monitors can cut their electricity bills by up to 20 percent. At the time of writing, the family's consumption had dropped dramatically, down 35 percent on the previous day, which Prescott estimates is a saving of around £300 ($475) on their annual electricity bill. Sadly the figures for the school and the island as a whole weren't quite so impressive. The school was up six percent on the previous day, while the island as a whole saw a two percent rise in usage. Prescott put these small rises down to the notoriously fickle British weather. \"Yesterday was lovely and sunny,\" he said. \"So far, today it has been rainy.\" The damp and gloom have meant more lights being switched on but despite these meteorological setbacks, Prescott remained upbeat about the success of the experiment. \"Before the family left home this morning they turned off everything they could, so their reduction in usage is a fantastic result,\" he said. Visitors to the the E-Day Web site can also play the\"5 Things\" game to find out what all sorts of household appliances cost to run and how much they cost you and the environment. \"The E-Day experiment will hopefully prove that the small things can make a big difference, especially when we work together and try to save energy,\" Prescott said. Prescott is also the founder of \"Ban the Bulb\" -- an energy efficiency campaign which is helping phase out the use of incandescent light bulbs in 30 countries. The event has been organized as part of a four-day Earth Summit event which has seen the Isles of Scilly play host to fellow islanders from Samoa, The Galapagos Islands, Madagascar and the Carteret Islands -- whose inhabitants are some of the first people being displaced by rising sea-levels.",

        "input": "Washington (CNN) -- The state dinner is Washington's top fete. And over the years, the Obama administration has weathered the party crashing Salahis â€” an incident which launched congressional scrutiny of White House security -- and a dinner-canceling snub from the Brazilian President last year after learning the United States was spying on her government. This White House has preferred to pare the pageantry in favor of quieter dinners with other world leaders. After all, state affairs, like the one set for Tuesday night for French President Francois Hollande, are glitzy and require huge guest lists and stodgier protocols. In fact, the Obamas have hosted just six state dinners, which is about the same number as George W. Bush. Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush threw more than 20, and Ronald Reagan hosted 35. Nonetheless, the state dinner, a tradition formalized under Ulysses S. Grant, is still a highly coveted social soiree. Here's the scoop: . Getting the details right: The White House social secretaries, State Department chief of protocol, first lady's office and others all work together to ensure that everything from culturally appropriate menus are prepared and customs honored. During the Obama's first state dinner for Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh guests ate red lentil soup with fresh cheese and a choice of entrees -- roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney, chick peas and okra for vegetarians, or green curry prawns, among other items. Tables were adorned with magnolia branches -- from species native to both India and the United States. Of course, this is also the party that Michaele and Tareq Salahi managed to attend without an invitation, so sometimes details slip through the cracks. The attire: State dinners are black tie affairs complete with tuxedos and designer gowns. New York-based designer Naeem Khan created a one of a kind strapless gold and silver gown which first lady Michelle Obama donned during the administration's first state dinner. For her first state dinner former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy wore \"wore a Grecian-style gown of pale yellow silk organza touched with brilliants,\" according to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. Not all of the attendees are fans of formal attire. Nikita Khrushchev, then-leader of the former Soviet Union, famously refused to wear tie and tails to the state dinner thrown in his honor by President Dwight Eisenhower. \"My husband would just as soon dress that way, too, if I'd let him,\" Mamie Eisenhower reportedly said. The setting: Well, the State Dining Room at the White House, of course. Tables are adorned with fine linen, china from presidencies past are often used, and the room is lit by gilded candelabras and chandeliers. Often, as in tonight's fete, dinners are hosted in a large white tent on the South Lawn of the White House. The event is sort of the wonk world's red carpet event and guests stream past a sea of cameras. The movie, \"The Butler,\" a loosely factual account of the life Eugene Allen, a butler at the White House for 34 years and through eight administrations, shows Allen and his wife attending a state dinner hosted by the Reagans for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Scoring an invite: If you have to ask, you're probably not on the list. The list is culled from recommendations from the President and first lady, top government officials, the Pentagon, members of Congress, the Supreme Court, and the State Department. Hollywood stars and community and business leaders are also often asked to attend. According to the White House website on state dinners, \"Behind the festive exterior of the social scene, the important business of government goes on -- information is gathered -- opinions exchanged -- powerful connections made and appearances upheld. For these reasons White House invitations are the most important and the most sought after in the nation's social whirl.\" A seat at the table: In the 1960s, Mrs. Kennedy dispensed with the long banquet tables of her predecessors in favor of round tables designed to give all guests an equal opportunity to rub elbows. It is a tradition that subsequent administrations have kept. The music: During the Obama administration state dinner guests have enjoyed music from such artists as BeyoncÃ©, Rodrigo y Gabriela, John Legend and British folk-rockers Mumford & Sons. On Tuesday night, Mary J. Blige will entertain.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Federal officers charged with keeping terrorists off planes are now searching their own ranks for staff who told CNN that few flights were protected by air marshals. Iraq war veteran Jeff Denning says a TSA investigator called him trying to find out if he spoke to CNN. The Transportation Security Administration rejected as a \"myth\" CNN's report that less than 1 percent of the nation's daily flights carry armed federal air marshals. Now the agency is conducting an investigation into who talked to CNN and who encouraged other agents to do the same. A spokesman for the TSA confirmed the investigation. Spokesman Christopher White said a TSA investigator is looking into the \"possible unauthorized release of sensitive and classified information to the news media by covered parties.\" \"As part of this ongoing investigation, several individuals, both current and former employees, have been contacted as is typical in any investigation,\" he said in an e-mail to CNN. CNN spoke to more than a dozen current and former air marshals, pilots and federal law enforcement officials for the report, which aired in March on \"Anderson Cooper 360º.\" Repeatedly, the sources told CNN that as few as 280 of an estimated 28,000 daily flights had armed federal air marshals aboard. That amounts to less than 1 percent. \"That number is absolutely wrong,\" said Kip Hawley, the head of the agency. He was speaking earlier this year before Congress, which held hearings into the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) in the wake of CNN's reporting. CNN learned of the TSA investigation from a former federal air marshal and Iraq war veteran, Jeff Denning. He was not connected to the original story. Denning said he was called by TSA investigator Greg Neiderer a few days after he came back from the front lines of Iraq. Denning said Neiderer grilled him on an e-mail he received on his personal account while he was in Iraq. The e-mail discussed plans to expose corruption in the air marshal service. The e-mail encouraged recipients to contact CNN correspondent Drew Griffin if they had information about the hiring of airport screeners as air marshals, the elimination of mandatory psychiatric tests for new hires and managers lying to Congress.  Read the e-mail » . CNN only recently received a copy of the e-mail. CNN did not have it when the report aired in March. Denning said he forwarded the e-mail to current and former air marshals. Denning said Neiderer wanted to know who sent him the e-mail. Nothing in the e-mail contained sensitive security information, Denning said, nor did it encourage anyone to disclose information that could endanger the public. \"I was petrified,\" Denning said of Neiderer's phone call, explaining how he contacted CNN full of dismay that the TSA was harassing him and his family to find out which of his former colleagues had talked to the media. \"In Iraq, there were a lot of dangerous things, but never have I been so scared [as] when the federal government called me on my home phone and said I want to know about your personal e-mail account and what you have been sending.\" TSA's Hawley refused repeated requests to be interviewed by CNN. Neiderer did not return repeated calls or e-mails. In an e-mail, TSA spokesman White confirmed Neiderer's involvement, but denied that the TSA or the Federal Air Marshal Service had accessed anyone's private e-mail accounts, via subpoena or otherwise. However, he added that \"all e-mails sent to government employees on a government system are always eligible to be read and reviewed as is outlined on every computer in TSA, including the FAMS.\" White did not say how much the investigation is costing taxpayers or how long it would last. With a few phone calls, CNN was able to find the author of the original e-mail. The author is an air marshal who asked that his identity be concealed for fear of retribution by the TSA. The marshal said he sent the e-mail because for six years, his colleagues have been trying to alert Congress about continuing problems in the air marshal service. Many have left, he said, because of low morale and complaints about management. A May 2008 report from the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General said that the agency \"currently experiences a 17% voluntary attrition rate and low employee morale.\" \"Congress doesn't want to hear it,\" the marshal said. \"They stick their heads in the sand. We tell them about the corruption. We give them examples and proof and I think they are scared of what they see. And they don't want to deal with it.\" The marshal said he had done nothing wrong by sending an e-mail. \"The only thing in my e-mail was my telling these other air marshals that CNN was willing to expose the corruption in the federal air marshal services and Mr. Griffin's e-mail address,\" he said. \"That's not sensitive security information. That's freedom of speech.\" He said he sent another e-mail urging air marshals to contact members of Congress investigating the air marshal service. Meanwhile, the air marshal service is undergoing a management change. Shortly after CNN aired its first report, director Dana Brown announced plans to retire. He has since decided to stay with the air marshals in a newly created position of Integrity Officer. His successor is Robert Bray, current deputy director, who, like Brown and Neiderer, is a former Secret Service employee. According to the TSA, Brown's job is to ensure that \"disciplinary measures and other personnel actions are administered uniformly throughout the organization.\" Former air marshal Denning said he thinks the TSA should spend its time tracking down terrorists instead of former employees' e-mails. \"If they want to tap into someone's personal e-mail because they were going to destroy the Pentagon or kill the president, I could see reasons for contacting someone,\" Denning said. \"But they're contacting me on my personal e-mail that I apparently forwarded to someone else's personal e-mail account. It's outlandish.\" CNN's Todd Schwarzschild contributed to this report.",
