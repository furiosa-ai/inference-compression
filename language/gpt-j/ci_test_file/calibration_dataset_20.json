        "input": "Dr. Conrad Murray was sentenced Tuesday to four years in the Los Angeles County jail -- the maximum sentence allowed under the law -- in the death of Michael Jackson. He may serve no more than two, however. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor, in a lengthy statement delivered before sentencing Murray for involuntary manslaughter, said he felt a significant responsibility to determine the appropriate sentence, utilizing his \"sense of fairness and decency.\" \"There are those who feel Dr. Murray is a saint,\" Judge Pastor said. \"There are those who feel Dr. Murray is the devil. He's neither. He's a human being. He stands convicted of the death of another human being.\" Automatic credit for good behavior lowers the actual time served to two years, which puts his projected release date in late 2013, Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Overheard on CNN.com: Is 4-year sentence fair? Murray is not eligible for early release electronic monitoring or house arrest, which some county prisoners get under a federal court order aimed at reducing jail overcrowding, Whitmore said.  \"He does not meet our requirements for any kind of home monitoring,\" he said. Members of Jackson's family, who sat in court for Tuesday's sentencing, appeared pleased with the judge's decision to ignore defense pleas for leniency. A statement from the family, read in court by a lawyer, said they were \"not here to seek revenge,\" but they wanted a sentence that \"reminds physicians that they cannot sell their services to the highest bidder and cast aside their Hippocratic oath to do no harm.\" It included a message to the judge from Jackson's three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket. \"We will grow up without a father, our best friend, our playmate and our dad,\" the children said. Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff acknowledged that it was unlikely Pastor would accept probation for Murray, but he still made a case for community service over time behind bars. \"He could do things for the community on probation that he could never do sitting in that little room,\" Chernoff said. Even without jail time, Chernoff said, he will suffer the rest of his life because of the loss of his medical career and the stigma of the conviction. \"Whether he is a barista the rest of his life, whether he is a greeter at Walmart, he's still going to be the man who killed Michael Jackson for the rest of his life,\" Chernoff said. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren, arguing for the maximum four years in jail, said Murray was \"playing Russian roulette with Michael Jackson's life every single night,\" by using the surgical anesthetic propofol to put him to sleep in \"a reckless, obscene manner.\" Murray showed his lack of remorse or acceptance of his personal responsibility in an interview nine days before he was found guilty, Walgren said. \"I don't feel guilty because I did not do anything wrong,\" Murray said in a documentary aired days after he was convicted. Pastor delivered a 30-minute explanation of why he was sentencing Murray to the maximum jail time, even though the doctor was technically eligible for probation. Murray's \"faux documentary\" made it appear he was just a \"bystander\" in Jackson's death who was \"entrapped\" and \"betrayed\" by his patient, Pastor said. \"Yikes!  Talk about blaming the victim,\" he said.  \"Not only isn't there any remorse, there's umbrage and outrage on the part of Dr. Murray against the decedent, without any, any indication of the slightest involvement in this case.\" Pastor said that while he had considered the entire \"book\" of Murray's life, he also had \"read the book of Michael Jackson's life.\" \"Regrettably, as far as Dr. Murray is concerned, the most significant chapter, as it relates to this case, is the chapter involving the treatment, or lack of treatment, of Michael Jackson.\" Jackson died \"not because of an isolated one-off occurrence or incident,\" Pastor said. \"He died because of a totality of circumstances which are directly attributable to Dr. Murray ... because of a series of decisions that Dr. Murray made.\" Murray, he said, became involved in \"a cycle of horrible medicine.\" He cited Murray's \"pattern of deceit and lies. That pattern was to assist Dr. Murray.\" A tape recording of Jackson's slurred voice was Murray's \"insurance policy,\" Pastor said. \"It was designed to record his patient surreptitiously at that patient's most vulnerable point. I can't even imagine that happening to any of us because of the horrific violation of trust.\" He said he wondered whether that tape would have been offered for sale, had Jackson not died and a rift had developed between the two in the future. One of the 12 jurors who found Murray guilty said in an interview airing Tuesday on HLN's \"Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell,\" that the recording did not play into the verdict. \"We talked about that audio a little bit,\" Debbie Franklin, known as \"Juror 5,\" said.  \"We didn't really understand why it was presented. I still do not understand what that was about.\" Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter three weeks ago after a trial in which prosecutors successfully argued that Murray's reckless use of propofol to help Jackson sleep, without proper monitoring equipment, led to the singer's death. \"We had decided the three issues we were going to focus on were the not calling 911, not having the medical equipment and him leaving the room,\" Franklin said.  \"That was the bottom line for this case.\" Testimony during the trial revealed that Murray gave propofol nearly every night in the two months before the singer's death on June 25, 2009, as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts set for London the next month. The judge set a hearing for January 23 to decide on the prosecution's request that Murray be ordered to pay Jackson's estate and his children more than $100 million in restitution for the \"wage and profits lost,\" as provided under California's \"victim's bill of rights\" law. The singer's \"estate estimates Michael Jackson's projected earnings for the 50-show O2 concert series to be $100 million,\" the prosecutors said. With nearly $2 million in funeral expenses and 10% interest added each year, the prosecution is asking Pastor to order Murray to pay Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson more than $120 million in restitution. While it is doubtful that Murray, who is unlikely to ever practice medicine again, could pay very much of that sum, it could prevent him from reaping financial benefits from any books, interviews or film projects in the future.",

        "input": "Roughly half the schedulers at multiple Veterans Affairs hospitals said they received instructions from supervisors to falsify data and hide the true time it took patients to be seen by a doctor after making an appointment, new details from an internal VA audit show. Schedulers said supervisors directed them to manipulate information so their centers could meet performance goals, which would help top officials get bonuses, according to documents obtained by CNN. The new information also provided to Congress this week includes updates from specific VA hospitals that were not included in an internal audit released last month by the embattled agency. The ongoing saga involves multiple investigations into delayed care, potentially with deadly results, alarming management shortcomings and a culture that was said to have compromised the mission of providing prompt and effective medical care to millions of veterans, some of them returning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. New VA secretary confirmed . VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned over the scandal in May. His replacement, Robert McDonald, was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday unanimously. The former corporate CEO and ex-Army officer has pledged to swiftly introduce reforms. Under pressure from constituents back home and most members facing voters in November, Congress is poised to approve a $17 billion bipartisan proposal before the week is out. It would allow the agency to hire more medical staff, lease new facilities, and give veterans the opportunity to seek care outside the VA system. It would also allow the VA secretary to more easily fire top officials. Details of delayed care were first reported by CNN in an investigation of two VA hospitals in the Southeast. Since, CNN reporting has expanded to include more hospitals and details of delayed care and allegations that up to 40 deaths were tied to the problem. Congress comes up with a deal on veterans . Greater range of problems . While the Phoenix VA medical center has received the most national scrutiny, the new information shows in greater depth a range of problems affecting numerous facilities nationwide. VA hospitals in Montgomery, Alabama, Clarksburg, West Virginia, and White City, Oregon, were among the worst cited in the new information. About 50% of schedulers at those facilities reported being told by their superiors to falsify data. Moreover, schedulers in Washington, Richmond, Gainesville, Florida, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and elsewhere used \"outside tracking logs\" to hide long delays in care by not properly recording information in the scheduling system, the documents showed. Numerous other VA medical centers may have improperly used \"paper wait lists\" or excel spreadsheets to hide delays, according to the new internal audit details. Data from the audit released last month found that 13% of schedulers surveyed nationally said they were directed by hospital administrators to enter appointment dates that were different from those requested by a veteran. But the newly released data showed 55 of the VA medical centers audited had more than 13% of schedulers reporting such direction, the documents showed. Bad VA care may have killed more than 1,000 veterans, senator's report says . Coaching schedulers . Scheduling staff training has been controversial throughout recent investigations of VA management. The audit also showed that half of schedulers surveyed could not remember the date of their last training. The findings also showed there were attempts to coach and prepare staff and schedulers in a number of cases before they were questioned by auditors. House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller said any VA administrator who ordered employees to purposely manipulate patient wait times should be immediately fired. \"The environment in today's Veterans Health Administration is one in which some VA executives are so driven in their quest for performance bonuses, promotions and power that they are willing to lie, cheat and put the health of the veterans they were hired to serve at risk,\" Miller said. Gingrich Opinion: We owe our veterans real change . VA takes action . The VA said in a statement on its website on Tuesday that it had proposed \"a series of disciplinary\" actions against six employees in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Fort Collins, Colorado, as a result of the audit. \"Employees who have been found to have manipulated data, withheld accurate information from their supervisors, and affected the timeliness of care veterans receive do not reflect VA's values, and their actions will not be tolerated,\" said Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson. Carolyn Lerner, head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, said, \"We are encouraged by the VA's action in response to Office of Special Counsel's reports regarding whistleblower disclosures of manipulated wait-time data that masked scheduling problems at the VA's Cheyenne and Fort Collins facilities.\" The office is charged with representing whistleblowers across the country. Who is Bob McDonald? Veterans waiting longer for cancer care . 'Corrosive culture,' weak leadership cripple VA, report says .",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Real Madrid reduced Barcelona's Spanish league lead to two points with a comfortable 2-0 victory at home to lowly Levante on Saturday, reaching a remarkable milestone for coach Jose Mourinho. First-half goals from Karim Benzema and Ricardo Carvalho were enough to give Mourinho's team a 19th victory in 24 La Liga games this season. The victory extended Real's unbeaten home La Liga run under Mourinho to 12 matches -- now 148 in total since his only career home league defeat when in charge of Porto on February 23, 2002. Mourinho has carried his incredible record through spells with English club Chelsea and European champions Inter Milan into his first season at the Santiago Bernabeu. Spanish titleholders Barcelona will seek to bounce back from Tuesday's Champions League defeat by Arsenal and last weekend's surprise draw with Sporting Gijon when Athletic Bilbao visit the Camp Nou on Sunday. Benzema, meanwhile, staked his claim for a starting place against his former club Lyon this coming Tuesday, when Real travel to France seeking revenge for last season's last-16 defeat in Europe's top club competition. Lyon warm up for Real clash with win . The 23-year-old has been vying for a place with loan signing Emmanuel Adebayor in the absence of the injured Gonzalo Higuain, and he scored his third league goal this season from close range after a superb run down the right by winger Angel Di Maria. Real dominated after that sixth-minute opener, and the second goal came four minutes before halftime when veteran Portugal defender Carvalho diverted in a vicious Cristiano Ronaldo free-kick for his third La Liga goal since leaving Chelsea in August. Second-half substitute Adebayor thought he had made it 3-0 in time added on, but Ronaldo was ruled to have been offside as he sought to pounce on a blocked shot from another replacement, Mesut Ozil. \"I liked that my team played a serious match. These games ahead of Champions League matches can be complicated because players may focus more on the European competition,\" Mourinho told reporters. \"The team played well and was very focused. We knew Levante would make it tough. They were organized in defense, but we scored early and had things under control. Winning and resting players is what mattered.\" The defeat left Levante two points above the bottom three, with the Valencia-based team hoping to avoid an immediate return to the second division. Third-placed Valencia lost ground on Madrid following a 0-0 draw at home to Sporting Gijon, who ended the day above 16th-placed Levante on goal difference. That result means fellow Champions League hopefuls Villarreal can draw level on 48 points with a win at home to bottom club Malaga on Sunday. Fifth-placed Atletico Madrid won 1-0 at Real Zaragoza in Saturday's late match, thanks to Sergio Aguero's second-half winner. The Argentine striker broke the deadlock with a flash of brilliance in the 65th minute as he received Diego Forlan's pass, burst into the penalty box and fired a low shot across the keeper and into the far corner. Zaragoza could have snatched a point, but Nigerian striker Ikechukwu Uche and on-loan Argentine midfielder Nicolas Bertolo both saw late efforts rebound off the Madrid crossbar. Zaragoza remained a point above third-bottom Osasuna, who host sixth-placed Espanyol on Sunday.",

        "input": "(CNN)  -- The head of the U.N. Children's Fund has expressed concern over a Saudi judge's refusal for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8-year-old girl and a 47-year-old man. UNICEF's Ann Veneman said consent cannot be free if either party is too young to make an informed decision. \"Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework, the marriage of a child is a violation of that child's rights,\" said Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF. \"The right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consent cannot be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision.\" The most recent ruling, in which the judge upheld his original verdict, was handed down Saturday in the Saudi city of Onaiza, where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl's mother, seeking a divorce for her daughter. Have your say by clicking here . A relative said the judge, Sheikh Habib al-Habib, \"stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty.\" The family member, who requested anonymity, added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter. The case, which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups, came to light in December when al-Habib declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality. The judge ruled that the girl's mother -- who is separated from her father -- was not the girl's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court, Abdullah al-Jutaili, the mother's attorney, told CNN at the time. The girl's father, according to the lawyer, arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man, who is a close friend of his. At the time of the initial verdict, the judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili told CNN. The judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty, she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court, the lawyer said. Last month, an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh declined to certify the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib's verdict, and sent the case back to him for reconsideration. Under the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect, but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing. The appeals court in Riyadh will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month, according to the relative. The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently. While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages, the kingdom's top cleric has said that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. \"It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,\" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in remarks last January, according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. \"A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong, and they are being unfair to her.\" Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry. \"We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,\" he said, according to the newspaper. \"We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women.\" Sharia law is Islamic law. Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism. CNN was unable to reach government officials for comment. Christoph Wilcke, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, told CNN in December that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages. \"We've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men,\" Wilcke said. Wilcke said that although Saudi ministries might make decisions designed to protect children, \"It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts, and in many realms beyond the court.\" In December, Zuhair al-Harithi, a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission, said his organization is fighting against child marriages. \"The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia,\" al-Harithi said. \"Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed.\" He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place. Wajeha al-Huwaider, co-founder of the Society of Defending Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, told CNN that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to \"keep us backward and in the dark ages.\" She said the marriages cause girls to \"lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression.\"",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Suspected Somali pirates hijacked a Greek-owned bulk carrier Wednesday with 22 crew members aboard, according to the European Union's Naval Force for Somalia. MV Filitsa was seized in the early morning about 460 miles (740 kilometers) northeast of the Seychelles as it headed toward Durban, South Africa, according to a news release from EU NAVFOR Somalia. The Marshall Island-flagged carrier -- with three Greek and 19 Filipino crew members -- \"has now turned around and is heading north,\" it said. The bulk carrier has a deadweight of more than 23,000 tons. There have been more than 100 pirate attacks and at least 39 hijackings off the east Africa this year, according to EU NAVFOR. In late October, Somali pirates seized a private yacht in the Indian Ocean, taking Paul and Rachel Chandler hostage. They have demanded a $7 million ransom for the British couple's release, but the government has refused to pay as a matter of long-standing policy. Two vessels were attacked the day after the Chandlers set sail. One of them -- a cargo ship -- was successfully boarded and seized off the Seychelles, while the other fought off its attackers near the Kenyan coast. Pirates are still holding a Spanish fishing boat, the Alakrana, which they seized on October 2 off Somalia's coast. Days later, they transferred three of the fishing boat's 36 crew members to land. Two pirate suspects had left the Alakrana in a small vessel heading toward land, authorities said, and the Spanish military swooped in to stop them on the high seas. They were later brought to Madrid, where a judge has charged them with piracy and kidnapping. The pirates holding the crew have demanded Spain release the two suspects. Spain is part of the European Union task force against piracy in the Indian Ocean off Somalia. The Spanish parliament last January agreed to increase Spain's presence with up to 395 troops and assets, including a frigate and aircraft. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report .",

        "input": "(CNN) -- A Texas grand jury declined to issue charges Thursday in a November 2012 deadly collision between a freight train and a parade float that killed four veterans and injured more than a dozen people, Assistant District Attorney Eric Kalenak of Midland County said. The accident happened on November 15 during the \"Hunt for Heroes\" parade to honor members of the U.S. military. The last flatbed truck in the parade was crossing the tracks when an eastbound Union Pacific train slammed into it, Midland police said. An attorney representing Smith Industries, the owner of the truck that served as the float, identified the driver as Dale Andrew Hayden. Civil litigation, however, is pending as the family of at least one deceased victim and several surviving victims, including one left paralyzed, are suing the railroad and Smith Industries, according to the website of the law firm Glasheen, Valles & Inderman in Lubbock, Texas. A second suit on behalf of families of two deceased veterans was filed in Dallas against the railroad, the law firm said. \"Of the twelve families who were on the float stuck by the train, nine have filed suit,\" the law firm said in a January announcement. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board said the grade crossing warning system, which consists of a bell, lights and a gate, operated as designed, giving a 20-second warning of the train's arrival. But the truck entered the crossing and the gate lowered, tipping over flag stands on the float. The board re-created the accident as part of an investigation. An NTSB board member said the south traffic light at the grade crossing turned green 21 seconds before the train's arrival at the crossing, as designed, to allow traffic time to clear the crossing. At 20 seconds before the collision, the bells and lights on the mast activated, in keeping with the minimum time under federal law. Those killed were identified as Marine Corps Chief Warrant Officer 3 Gary Stouffer, 37; Army Sgt. Maj. Lawrence Boivin, 47; Army Sgt. Joshua Michael, 34; and Army Sgt. Maj. William Lubbers, 43.

        "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Control tower tapes reveal that the pilot of presidential hopeful Barack Obama's plane told air traffic controllers there was an emergency when he made an unscheduled landing last month in St. Louis, Missouri. Barack Obama's plane had to make an unscheduled landing on July 7 in St. Louis, Missouri. On July 7 the Midwest Airlines MD-81 made an unscheduled landing during the flight from Chicago, Illinois, to Charlotte, North Carolina. The owner of the plane initially said the landing was not caused by an emergency. However the tapes, released to ABC News through a Freedom of Information Act request, contradict that report. ABC first reported on the tapes on Thursday. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown told CNN Thursday evening that preliminary information for incidents is often incomplete or incorrect.  Watch what the tapes revealed » . According to the tapes, the pilot told an FAA air traffic controller that he had limited ability to move the plane's nose up and down. \"We have limited pitch authority at flight levels; we're descending to see if we can regain pitch authority,\" the pilot told the air traffic controller. \"At this time we would like to declare this an emergency and also have CFR (fire and rescue equipment) standing by in St. Louis,\" the pilot said. The pilot remained calm throughout the recording. Midwest Airlines acknowledged at the time that the pilot had detected a control problem in the pitch of the plane after an emergency evacuation chute opened in the aircraft's tail cone while in flight. Normally, the chute deploys only after landing and after the tail cone pops off. The pitch, or angle of the nose of an airplane, affects the pilot's ability to control the plane. The airline said the pilot had \"full authority of the aircraft.\" According to the tapes, the pilot said he regained control as the plane began to descend into St. Louis. \"We had a pitch authority problem, now that we have come down to a lower altitude it seems to have rectified itself. We do have pitch control of the aircraft at this time,\" he said. Fire trucks met the aircraft when it landed at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. After the plane landed, Obama told reporters the plane landed because of a mechanical problem and noted it marked the first time he had had to do so. \"Just thought we'd spice things up a little bit today,\" he joked. \"Anytime a pilot says that something's not working the way its supposed to, then, you know, you make sure you tighten your seat belt. Everything seemed under control, the pilots knew what they were doing.\" The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident, said last month that there was no evidence of tampering. An \"examination of the hardware did not reveal any evidence of missing components, nor any evidence of tampering,\" the board said. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- As has frequently been the case in the last two-and-a-half years, I found myself this past weekend caught in an intense conversation about the ongoing civil war in Syria. This time it was with a supporter of the al-Assad government. He was relentless, insisting that there was no choice but victory, at any cost, especially since the government has been facing foreign fighters from \"83 countries.\" It's a common refrain I've heard in different variations from all sides of the conflict -- there is no choice but victory. As the world debates the efficacy of a military strike against the al-Assad government in response to its use of chemical weapons on civilians, the fighting on the ground shows no signs of abating. It is clear that the Syrian people are caught between a zero-sum political game being played by the regime and rebels, and their respective backers. Despite lofty rhetoric from a number of countries, diplomatic efforts towards a political solution could have been more vigorous. Opinion: Syria a distraction from real U.S. challenges . Calling for an immediate cease-fire on all sides is the only path towards peace. But will the United States and other key players go down that road? The Syrian uprising began in March 2011, partly in response to the imprisonment and brutal treatment of teenagers in the southern city of Daraa, who had tagged some buildings with anti-government graffiti. Initially, the protesters avoided mentioning dictator Bashar al-Assad by name. But the demonstrations quickly intensified in the face of continued government crackdowns. By August of the same year, over 2,000 Syrians had been killed and the security apparatus of the regime was out in full force, attempting to crush any dissent, peaceful or otherwise through the dastardliest of means. It was no surprise then that the standoff turned violent, as ragtag militias formed to contest government forces. Soon, there was an influx of weapons from neighboring Iraq and distant Libya, as well as foreign reinforcements on the side of the fragmented rebel fighters. By the spring of 2012, the conflict had clearly transformed into a civil war. Since then, the violence has only escalated and the death toll climbed, as the battles have moved from city to city across the country. Entire neighborhoods in Homs, Aleppo, Hama, and elsewhere have been destroyed to rubble. Four questions for backers of Syria mission . The al-Assad government ultimately bears responsibility for the conflict and most of the deaths. However, both sides have committed crimes against humanity. With over 100,000 Syrians dead and millions more displaced internally or as refugees in neighboring countries, the United States, Britain, Russia, China and others have mostly looked on. Instead of bringing the contesting forces to the table to force them to a solution, the United States and Russia and their regional allies continue to send money and arms into the conflict. When was the last time President Obama called for an immediate cease-fire? When was the last time that the U.S. and Russia said simply and with integrity: Stop the violence. Opinion: A U.S. strike would be self-wounding . This call has been missing for fear it could undermine the rebels (or for Russia, the regime). Nowhere was this more apparent than in the battle for Qusayr, which unfolded in front of the world's eyes earlier in the summer, with Hezbollah forces buttressing the al-Assad regime on one side and foreign fighters helping the opposition on the other side. The United Nation envoys, including Kofi Annan and Lakdar Brahimi, have tried to facilitate talks, but with little result, mostly because they were sent to Syria with their hands tied behind their back. Without the political backing from the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, what authority could their initiatives have? We cannot give up on the political process and negotiations, even if the U.S. carries out a military strike, even if there are countless bombings in coming weeks, and even if we can only achieve a brief reprieve from the violence. Opinion: On Syria, Obama must show strong grip . We need to revisit the Geneva discussions, which began in 2012 and outlined roughly a \"transition plan.\" There's also the oft-touted Geneva 2 meeting -- which has yet to be scheduled -- where a future power-sharing agreement in Syria would be discussed. The Geneva 2 meeting would bring together key constituents, including the rebels and the regime. While this process, held under the auspices of the U.N., is far from perfect and may well be a long shot, it offers the best chance towards a political solution to the Syrian conflict.

Oscar Eugene Richardson, 61, was arrested Saturday in Ridgedale, Missouri, as a result of information received through a police hot line, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the state Department of Corrections said. He is the first fugitive captured as part of the Florida \"12 Days of Fugitives\" campaign. \"Richardson is the oldest case among the dozen escapees and it is fitting that justice caught up with him first,\" said Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey. Richardson escaped from the Kissimmee Work Release center in March 1979 after serving less than two years of his 10-year sentence, police said. He had robbed a Tampa, Florida, drugstore in January 1977, holding two employees at gunpoint as he demanded money from the store's safe. Two months later he robbed a convenience store in Tampa, holding the clerk at gunpoint and demanding she fill a bag with money, authorities said. He fled but was apprehended minutes later. At the time of his arrest Saturday, Richardson was living under the alias Eugene Ward and using a false Social Security number, officials said. Police believe he had been living in the same area of Missouri for many years. He was arrested by a U.S. Marshals Service task force. The 12 Days of Fugitives campaign, launched December 7, is aimed at Florida's oldest and most violent prison escapees, the departments' statement said. Newspapers are featuring the fugitives in print and online photo galleries and the Florida Outdoor Advertising Association and its member companies are providing donated space on billboards. \"The campaign is designed to reach the public during the holiday season, when investigators believe the wanted men are most likely to contact friends, family and loved ones,\" the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said. More than $22,000 in reward money is available -- up to $2,500 per fugitive -- for information leading to their capture. The money is provided by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Department of Corrections and the Florida Police Chiefs' Association.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- The top dogs ruled the world's most famous hot dog eating contest, once again. Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest is always a big event, drawing thousands to Brooklyn's Coney Island to cheer on some of the world's most accomplished competitive eaters. But this year's edition proved extra special for historical, dramatic and sentimental reasons. Making history was Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut. The San Jose, California, resident was no stranger to the Coney Island contest before he won his seventh hot dog-eating title Thursday. That's cumulative and consecutive, as he's won each of these events since 2007. But it's how he did it this time -- topping his own record by gobbling 69 frankfurters and buns in 10 minutes -- that proved one for the record books. His 69 downed dogs is the most by anyone since the competition began in 1916, and one ahead of the 68 mark he'd set last July 4 as well as in 2009. \"Sixty-nine is the magic number,\" Chestnut told ESPN, which broadcast the event. \"Came out here, the crowd pushed me, they would not let me slow down. And it's awesome\" While there was no doubt Chestnut would win after he pulled away to top his nearest foe by 19 hot dogs, the same couldn't be said for the women's event. Every bite counted as Sonya \"The Black Widow\" Thomas and Juliet Lee dueled down to the wire. When the clock ran out, the scoreboard had it as a tie -- 36 hot dogs apiece. But the judges tipped the scales in Thomas' favor, ruling that the Alexandria, Virginia, resident had gorged on 36ยพ hot dogs. That was ยพ more than Lee, enough to give Thomas her third title despite the fact her final tally was far below the 45 hot dogs she put away last Independence Day. Still, Thomas and Chestnut's championships were significant as much for where they took place, as for what they did. Parts of Coney Island, on Brooklyn's southern coast some 12 miles south of Lower Manhattan, were ravaged eight months ago when Superstorm Sandy rolled through. Scores of businesses and backdrops that tens of thousands associate with summer fun suffered major damage there and in other places, like the Jersey Shore. Yet the hum of amusement park rides and the buzz of the throngs packing to cheer on Chestnut, Thomas and others on Thursday is proof that, for one day at least, Coney Island is back.",

It also treats Palestinian patients brought in from Gaza, although none were there when CNN visited. The hospital has been a frequent victim of rocket attacks. Sirens went off as Dr. Chezy Levy, the hospital's general manager, spoke. To prepare for more casualties, the hospital has brought in more surgeons and cleared its operating schedule, he said. It has 12 surgical rooms, including five in reinforced shelters. Levy said soldiers have been brought in with shrapnel wounds, gunshot wounds -- often to legs and arms -- and also other injuries consistent with a war zone. \"Since the campaign started with the infantry troops, we got a lot of casualties among the soldiers and we treated them here,\" he said. In total, 425 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It's unknown how many were militants. The United Nations has estimated that 70% were civilians. Eighteen Israeli soldiers have been killed, in addition to two civilians.

        "input": "(CNN) -- Keeping Sumatran tigers, orangutans and elephants in captivity is not an ideal situation. These animals should be in the wild. The problem is, their habitat is dwindling to such a low level, and it's often safer for the animals to live in captivity. The habitat for critically endangered Sumatran tigers has dwindled so much and poaching is such a large threat that there are more Sumatran tigers in captivity than live in the wild. As the number of tigers decrease, the captive tigers are the species' only hope for survival. There are those animals living in captivity that can't be released back into the wild. These are animals with diseases or defects like tigers that were rescued from poacher's snares. Many of these tigers are missing paws and parts of their legs. In the wild, they would have difficulty finding food and escaping danger. In this case, the tigers are put in zoos or sanctuaries like Taman Safari Indonesia featured in Expedition: Sumatra. Read more: The battle to save Sumatra's elephants . Animals in sanctuaries like this can serve an important purpose. They are ambassadors of their kind, educators of sorts for people to learn about them. The more people know about these animals and hear about the problems these animals face in the wild, the less likely they will want to kill them or destroy their habitat. The animals also inspire fundraising for the important work conservationist groups are doing to preserve these species. Captive animals also have another important role. In the wild, as populations decline, animals start to mate with their close relatives creating problems associated with inbreeding. When sanctuaries and zoos breed these animals, they make sure to do it with the genetic diversity of the species in mind. It is all a proactive approach that could prevent the extinction of the species. Read more: The final days of the Sumatran tiger? It's the sad truth that humans are causing and trying to the problem of animal population loss. Some of us are turning the rainforest into giant palm oil plantations and some of us are working to save that rainforest. Some of us are killing the tigers to sell their skins and some of us are taking care of disabled baby tigers in captivity to make sure the species doesn't go extinct. We humans are at war with ourselves and it's a war the endangered Sumatran wildlife is slowing losing. Without some kind of action to stop poaching and habitat loss, the critically endangered Sumatran elephants, orangutans and tigers will slowly and quietly decline. These once majestic species will only be seen behind a barrier at a zoo. Eventually, the species will go extinct. That's what conservationists at sanctuaries and zoos as well as non-profit groups like WWF are pushing so hard to stop. Education through the animal ambassadors in captivity is one way to help reverse the trend and hopefully save the species from irradiation.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- U.S. Sen. Jon Tester is famous for his flat-top and middle of the road politics. Amanda Curtis, Tester's fellow Democrat and would-be colleague from Montana, is known for her nose ring and her unabashedly liberal affiliations. Although many insiders dismiss her campaign as a long shot, Amanda Curtis is raising money at a prodigious rate and battling assertions that she is too radical for conservative-leaning Montana. But on many issues, the candidate admits she needs to study up. But time is running out with Election Day a little more than two months away. Curtis, a Butte math teacher serving her first-term in the Montana state house, has already raised $180,000 in 10 days, according to her campaign, and sees \"people coming out of the woodwork\" to support her. According to Curtis, who spoke with CNN last week, her nomination as the Democratic Senate candidate \"came from incredible circumstance.\" Curtis added that she had not even planned to seek re-election to her seat in the state legislature, let alone run for the U.S. Senate. An untested candidate . But that \"incredible circumstance\" comes with a price for Curtis and the Democrats who thrust an untested candidate into the national spotlight overnight. When asked her position on the situation in Iraq, Curtis told CNN, \"Give me a little more time.\" On the border crisis, \"I'll need more time, you know only 11 days ago I was painting my storm windows.\" One area the teacher had a firm answer was Common Core, the controversial national education standards opposed by teachers' unions but supported by the Obama administration. Curtis said, \"I am excited by Common Core, as a teacher ... but there has been a rush to implement it and that's the problem.\" Montana State University professor David Parker concedes that \"she's clearly rough. ... It's going to take time to get her answers down to sound bite quality.\" Not going to back down . But Robyn Driscoll, a Democratic Montana state senator, finds the lack of polish \"a refreshing change from the usual spin. ... Her approach tells voters she is not going to back down.\" Her priorities: access to public lands, opposition to Rep. Paul Ryan's House GOP budget, and \"economic policies for the 100%, not the 1%.\" Curtis, 34, has already garnered the support of the state's unions, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean's Democracy for America and Tester, the state's two-term Democratic senator. \"As Montana's senior senator, I'll be supporting Amanda as well as all Democrats who are talking about the issues that are important to Montana,\" Tester told CNN. \"Amanda's energy and enthusiasm will be a refreshing change and will bring attention to issues facing working families like education and access to our public lands.\" Tester helping out . Tester's spokeswoman Marnee Banks confirmed that he has been helping Curtis fundraise and plans to continue to make calls on her behalf. When Tester's counterpart, Max Baucus, left the Senate this year for the U.S. ambassador's post in Beijing, Montana Democrats were in a pickle. They needed a replacement. They chose John Walsh, a decorated veteran, the head of the state's National Guard and its lieutenant governor, to keep the seat blue. It was already an uphill battle in the Big Sky state against popular freshman U.S. Rep. Steve Daines, the Republican nominee. Then the plagiarism charges hit after a New York Times story detailed how Walsh lifted large parts of his master's thesis from others' work. Walsh dropped his campaign within two weeks, vowing to stay in the Senate. Little time to vet candidate . Rushing to fill the seat, they chose Curtis at a nominating convention with little time to vet her for the job. After the nomination was announced, the state Republican Party circulated a montage of Curtis's Youtube videos that catalogue her first term as a state representative. In the video, Curtis is critical of gun-rights supporters, calls herself \"an anarchist at heart,\" and explains she had to restrain herself from punching a fellow state representative who expressed anti-gay sentiments. Chairwoman of the Young Democrats of Montana Marissa Perry said the GOP is taking the remarks out of context in an attempt to smear Curtis. \"I encourage you to watch the whole thing. They are not showing the full story,\" Perry told CNN. Curtis, for her part, stands by the videos she contends are being manipulated, and encouraged voters to watch them in their entirety. \"Those videos are my public record,\" Curtis said. Conservative criticism . Conservative critics have unearthed other controversial statements and affiliations, including Curtis' association with the Industrial Workers of the World. IWW is a far left union movement that hopes to \"take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth,\" according to its website. Her husband, Kevin, is listed as a local organizer for IWW in Montana. Phil Kerpen of the conservative advocacy group American Commitment, which first published Curtis' affiliation with IWW, told CNN, \"Plagiarism disqualified a Senate candidate, but extremist ideology, advocacy of violence, and membership in the Industrial Workers of the World results in nothing but praise for his replacement. This is what the Democratic Party has become in 2014.\" Curtis campaign manager Clayton Elliot was asked about the union affiliation and criticism, but replied by emphasizing her populist approach. \"Amanda grew up in a family that struggled to put food on the table so she knows first hand the struggles of Montana working families. Unlike Congressman Daines, Amanda believes that we must put working Montana families ahead of corporate special interests,\" Elliot said. Dems see her as a net-plus . Democratic strategists see Curtis's firebrand politics as a net-plus, if not for her race, for down ballot races. They confided that before her entry into the race, liberal voters were unlikely to turn out for the Democratic ticket in an off-year. The Curtis run will change that, they told CNN. The Senate Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, is widely expected to lay low and not invest in the Curtis campaign, which is down double digits in the latest polling. Professor Parker thinks it increasingly unlikely Curtis will receive significant outside support \"unless she closes in on Daines in the polls and money race.\" For their part, the National Republican Senate Committee is confident that Curtis won't be able to breakthrough against Daines, who has a huge advantage in name recognition and fundraising. \"Our strategy will remain internal, but it seems telling that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is telling allies that they've given up on the race entirely,\" said NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen. But Curtis backers remain upbeat. Driscoll said the GOP \"should take (Amanda) seriously\" since she raised $150,000 in the first week of her campaign \"just using social media!\" Calls by CNN to the DSCC seeking comment were not immediately returned.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Few dinosaurs have as interesting a back story as the spinosaurus. In life, it dominated the waterways -- a 50-foot-long behemoth that employed its blade-like claws and conical, razor-sharp teeth to annihilate its prey. It chomped down on sharks for breakfast. Ninety-five million years after its extinction, this strangely aquatic dinosaur -- the only one of its kind that we know of -- has had to contend with Nazis, bomb raids, armed gangs and mysterious moustachioed men. Its story has all the makings of a spy novel. The most recent chapter in the spinosaurus' long and very bizarre tale occurred last year when Nizar Ibrahim, a German-Moroccan palaeontologist from the University of Chicago, uncovered the most complete skeleton fossil of the species yet found in Morocco's Sahara Desert. It also happens to be the only remaining skeleton of the species, as all other physical evidence of the spinosaurus was obliterated 70 years ago. \"It's a really mysterious dinosaur. (Until now), all we had was little bits and pieces, tantalizing clues and drawings of a partial skeleton that had been destroyed in World War II,\" explains Ibrahim. Early bones . The first, and up until recently only, spinosaurus skeleton ever found was uncovered by a fossil collector working for German palaeontologist Ernst Stromer -- then one of the world's leading experts on the enigmatic dinosaurs of North Africa. For years, Stromer unearthed a paleontological treasure trove in the Sahara. \"Ernst Stromer was really a very productive scientist. He was an explorer, and he was really the first person to resurrect the lost world of Africa's dinosaurs in a big way,\" says Ibrahim. Unfortunately, his luck turned with the onset of a war that would rob him of his sons -- two died in battle while the third barely survived a five-year imprisonment -- and his life's work. Most of his finds were stored at a palaeontology museum in Munich. He begged the director to relocate the dinosaur collection, but was refused, and in April 1944, an allied air raid destroyed the institution and Stromer's findings. \"Everything went up in flames, and Stromer lost all these incredible finds in a single night,\" recalls Ibrahim, who considers Stromer his role model. \"Resurrecting the spinosaurus -- his most famous discovery -- was the best way to bring Stromer back into the books of dinosaur palaeontology,\" he says. The man with the mustache . Ibrahim's hunt for the spinosaurus began in 2008 when he met a moustachioed Moroccan fossil hunter who was proffering rare-looking samples from a cardboard box. \"One piece looked really interesting. It was a blade-shaped piece of bone and I did think at the time that maybe this is a chunk of the spine of spinosaurus,\" he recalls. Years later, colleagues from the Natural History Museum in Milan showed him similar samples of what they, too, believed was a partial skeleton of a spinosaurus. \"It was spectacular. We had leg bones and spines and ribs and skull bones. It was very exciting, but we had a big problem. We had no idea where the skeleton came from, (which) means we don't know anything about the environment the animal lived in, the geological context, or if the bones were found in the same place,\" he says. With a closer look, however, the bones looked familiar. Ibrahim suspected they not only came from the same site as the specimen he was shown in Morocco, but from the same dinosaur. What followed was a five-year hunt for the man with the mustache -- it was the only detail Ibrahim remembered about the encounter. In 2013, Ibrahim called off the search while sipping mint tea with colleagues in a Moroccan cafe. \"I think I was a little naive and very optimistic, and ... we thought, OK, we can't find the guy, so that's the end of our mission impossible. Just like in a bad Hollywood movie, the very moment when I was ready to throw in the towel, a man walked passed our table. The man had a mustache and it was the man I had been looking for.\" After Ibrahim caught up with him, the man took him back to where he first made the finds. Further excavations dug up even more bones, most likely from the same animal. The collection painted the most complete picture to date of what the animal looked like and how it lived. Mainly, Ibrahim was able to ascertain that spinosaurus was an aquatic dinosaur (a first; previously, there was no known evidence of such a creature). Dense bones -- rare in dinosaurs but common in penguins -- provided the animal with buoyancy in rivers, while a crocodile-like snout helped it both to breathe and sense movement underwater. A seven-foot \"sail\" on the animal's back helped it navigate through the seas. The findings were published in the journal Science last month, are the cover story of this month's issue of National Geographic, and are also currently the subject of an exhibit at the National Geographic Museum in Washington. The Sahara: Land of giants . The Sahara of today can be pretty inhospitable. The land is vast and remote, and offers few visual clues. Temperatures rarely dip below 100 F, and high winds make for some ferocious sandstorms. The sand is also riddled with booby traps: Scorpions, snakes and landmines -- not to mention the odd armed militia doing the rounds -- which tend to keep most palaeontologists at bay. Ibrahim, however, is addicted to the landscape. \"The Sahara is a magical place. You'll find fossils of giant fish and river turtles and crocodile-like predators, and that's when it hits you: This place was very, very different 95 million years ago. It was a bizarre world, really like a different planet,\" he says. In place of the current, seemingly endless expanse of sand, there was a river system that housed all manner of strange creatures. \"I call it 'the river of giants.' (There were) giant sawfish and lungfish, flying reptiles -- some with wingspans of six or seven meters -- and lots of predatory dinosaurs.\" It's a place Ibrahim is eager to revisit. \"Let's just say this isn't the last time I travel to the Sahara in search of lost worlds and bizarre creatures,\" he says.",

        "input": "Editor's note: Angelo Falcón, a political scientist, is president of the National Institute for Latino Policy, a nonprofit think tank on issues affecting the Latino community. He is co-editor of \"Boricuas in Gotham: Puerto Ricans in the Making of Modern New York,\" and author of the \"Atlas of Stateside Puerto Ricans.\" Angelo Falcón says Sonia Sotomayor's identification as a Puerto Rican has caused her joy and a little grief. NEW YORK (CNN) -- The nomination of Sonia Sotomayor for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States has raised the profile of Puerto Ricans in the American consciousness. Her identification as a Puerto Rican has caused Judge Sotomayor both joy and a little grief during this stormy nomination process. But, being a Puerto Rican who also grew up in New York City, well, I can say that's par for the course for most of us. Despite Puerto Rico being a possession of the United States since 1898, most Americans know very little about the island and Puerto Ricans -- except for tourism commercials. Many consider Puerto Ricans living in the United States outside of Puerto Rico (I called these \"Stateside Puerto Ricans\") another new immigrant group of Latinos. But the reality is that we can trace Puerto Rican settlements in New Orleans to the 1860s and workers from Puerto Rico migrated to Hawaii around 1900. In 1917, through an act of the United States Congress (the Jones Act), the people of Puerto Rico were made United States citizens, enabling them to come to the United States freely and legally without passport or visa. I grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York, in an area known as \"Los Sures\" (The Southside). Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1951, my mother brought me to New York when I was only 6 months old. Now, to point out how different we are from most Americans, check this out: Despite living 99 percent of my life in New York and being a U.S. citizen for 100 percent of my life, under some interpretations of the law, because I was not born in a state of the United States (nor were my parents), I may not even be eligible to run for president of the United States! I am not sure how this has affected my career development, but I am sure it has resulted in some deep psychological trauma that I have yet to understand. Puerto Ricans have been migrating to the United  States since the 1800s, but it wasn't until World War II that this population movement peaked. At the time of this \"Great Migration\" over 80 percent of the Puerto Rican population in the United States lived in New York City. \"West Side Story,\" \"The Blackboard Jungle,\" Piri Thomas' book, \"Down These Mean Streets,\" all tried to capture this experience. It was a time when we became social guinea pigs, the subjects of Oscar Lewis' \"culture of poverty\" experiments and the like. Fast forward to today: The 800,000 Puerto Ricans in New York City represent about 20 percent of the more than 4 million Puerto Ricans living stateside. There are now more Puerto Ricans living stateside than in Puerto Rico. The fastest-growing Puerto Rican settlements in the States are in Florida and the South, not in the Northeast and Midwest where Puerto Ricans traditionally migrated. While once seen as basically a very poor community, the stateside Puerto Rican community has become more economically, politically and culturally complex than ever. Alongside very poor Puerto Ricans in areas such as the South Bronx, there are growing middle-class Puerto Rican neighborhoods in the New York suburbs. Settlements in states such as Florida, Texas and California are full of Puerto Rican professionals --- surgeons, engineers, lawyers. Where once this was seen as a very politically liberal community captured by the Democratic Party, in these newer settlements we are seeing a growing trend toward conservative politics. Then there is Puerto Rico. There are about 4 million residents, 95 percent of whom identify as Puerto Rican. Puerto Rico is a territorial possession of the United States, which was formally defined a commonwealth after a vote by its residents in 1952. The U.S. Congress is currently debating its future political status -- whether it should remain a commonwealth, or become a state or an independent nation. And it appears Puerto Ricans living stateside are as divided on this question as those in Puerto Rico. The U.S. Supreme Court once described Puerto Rico's relationship to the United States as \"foreign in a domestic sense.\" Don't worry, I don't know what that means either. But it does point to a rather convoluted relationship embodied in a series of Supreme Court decisions called the Insular Cases. The bottom line is Puerto Rico is an integral part of the United States. They use the same currency, follow the same laws and are subject to the same federal courts system. They even have the same fast food places -- so they are killing themselves dietarily just like the rest of the United States. However, did you know that despite being U.S. citizens, the people of Puerto Rico can't vote for the U.S. president? And Puerto Rico is excluded when the U.S. Census Bureau reports its numbers on Hispanic population in the United States? So, next time you hear a report on U.S. Hispanic population, add 4 million to get it right! As Judge Sotomayor's Puerto Rican heritage is discussed in reference to her nomination, it is clear that it is an experience that is thoroughly American. Exotic as we may sound to some, we are a people just trying to get by and as bewildered by American politics and jusiprudence as the next guy. Judge Sotomayor, as a Puerto Rican, is, well, as American as mango pie. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Angelo Falcón.",

        "input": "Washington (CNN) -- Iraq is open for business, and American companies should make an effort to invest there, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. \"President Obama and I and our government believe strongly that expanding economic opportunity is as essential as building democratic institutions,\" Clinton said while surrounded by executives from companies as far-ranging as Occidental Petroleum, JP Morgan Chase, General Electric, Microsoft and Lockheed Martin, in a round-table discussion aimed at getting companies focused on commercial opportunities in Iraq despite its current \"tough environment.\" The meeting comes as the United States transitions from a military-led to a civilian-led partnership with the Iraqi government by the end of the year. The State Department is leading an inter-agency effort to support American companies in their efforts to secure commercial opportunities in Iraq. With one of the largest customer bases in the Arab world, along with one of the best-educated work forces in the region, Clinton said, Iraq poses significant opportunities for American companies. The International Monetary Fund has projected for Iraq to grow faster than China over the next two years, she said. The United States, through its embassy and consulates throughout the country, stands ready to assist American companies \"to help create the conditions for investment and growth that will be broadly spread and create a ladder of economic opportunity for those willing to work hard,\" Clinton said. \"Iraqis are looking to rebuild every sector of their economy, not only their oil sector but agribusiness, transportation, housing, banking and many others.\" With additional help from the Departments of Treasury, Energy and Agriculture, among others, the United States will actively support efforts of American businesses to set up operations to compete with Turkish, Chinese, French, Jordanian and Iranian companies already seeking business opportunities in Iraq. James Jeffrey, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, is also working to establish an American Chamber of Commerce in Iraq to serve as an advocate for American businesses. Despite the opportunity Iraq offers, Clinton said, she would \"not sugarcoat\" the difficulties posed by the current working environment in Iraq. \"There are still significant security challenges, bottlenecks in infrastructure, unclear regulations and, unfortunately, corruption. But as our Iraqi colleagues will tell you, they are working hard to make it easier to do business in Iraq for Iraqis and foreign investors alike.\" Clinton said the United States would also make it a priority to support the integration of women into the Iraqi work force. \"I know that a lot of the best students in Iraqi universities happen to be women, and I hope that Iraq takes full advantage of half the population, ready to work, ready to roll up their sleeves to assist in the transformation of their country,\" she said. Thirty companies were represented at the event in the Benjamin Franklin room at the State Department. The Iraqi ambassador to the United States, Samir Sumaidaie, attended as well.",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Russia still has about 1,000 troops inside eastern Ukraine, a NATO military officer said Thursday, a week after Ukraine's government and pro-Russian rebels agreed to a ceasefire aimed at ending months of conflict. NATO also sees 20,000 more Russian troops aligned along the border, the NATO officer told CNN. He was not named according to standard practice in the organization. NATO believes that these numbers amount to a large and effective military force, the officer said. In addition to the troop numbers, NATO continues to see sophisticated Russian military equipment in Ukraine. NATO remains concerned and urges Russia to engage with the international community and Ukraine to find a political solution to the crisis, the officer said. Moscow has consistently denied allegations by Kiev and the West that Russia has troops in Ukraine, and that it has armed and supported the rebels. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said some 70% of the Russian troops believed to have been in Ukraine had withdrawn back across the border, according to the national news agency Ukrinform. Information released by Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council on Thursday indicated that the rebel forces control a strip of eastern Ukraine running from the city of Luhansk down to the Sea of Azov. 'Very fragile' ceasefire . The truce was signed Friday after talks in Minsk, Belarus, between representatives of Ukraine, the rebels and Russia. But more substantive talks on issues, including the decentralization of power and constitutional reform in Ukraine, must still take place before a lasting resolution can be found. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich told a briefing Thursday that the ceasefire was \"very fragile\" and that both sides must implement the framework agreed to in Minsk. \"There is mounting evidence of the Kiev government strengthening its military groups in different areas, regions; there are eyewitness reports to prove it,\" he said, \"though Ukrainian authorities keep on reassuring us that they're not planning a military operation.\" Lukashevich said Russia was also surprised by NATO's announcement of plans to hold joint military exercises with Kiev in Ukraine later this year. \"This might cause the escalation (of the situation) and put the progress in peaceful settlement of the crisis in Ukraine under threat,\" he warned. New sanctions . A new round of European Union sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine will come into force Friday, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said Thursday. EU officials will review the implementation of the ceasefire before the end of the month, he said, after which the sanctions could be amended or lifted. The sanctions include tougher restrictions on Russia's access to EU capital markets; a ban on loans by EU companies or individuals to five major Russian state-owned banks; a ban on debt financing to three major Russian defense companies and three major energy companies; and an asset freeze and travel ban against 24 more individuals. This means 119 people in total are now subject to sanctions, while 23 entities remain under an asset freeze in the European Union. Russia has warned it will respond to any additional measures. In his remarks, Lukashevich said the deadly crash in July of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 -- which Kiev and the West believe was shot down from rebel-held territory using a Russian-made missile launcher -- was being used to justify the imposition of broad Western sanctions against Russia. A preliminary report into the crash released this week by Dutch investigators did not apportion blame for the crash but said the plane was brought down by \"high-energy objects\" from outside. The United States will join the European Union in implementing additional sanctions against Russia over its \"illegal actions in Ukraine,\" President Obama said Thursday. \"We will deepen and broaden sanctions in Russia's financial, energy, and defense sectors,\" he said. The administration will outline the specifics of the sanctions Friday. \"We are implementing these new measures in light of Russia's actions to further destabilize Ukraine over the last month, including through the presence of heavily armed Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. We are watching closely developments since the announcement of the ceasefire and agreement in Minsk, but we have yet to see conclusive evidence that Russia has ceased its efforts to destabilize Ukraine,\" Obama said. Aid convoy . Lukashevich also said there had not yet been a \"breakthrough\" allowing a new Russian aid convoy to start moving into Ukraine in the next few days. \"We hope that the delivery will be carried out with participation of Ukraine's border guards and customs officers as well as officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross,\" he said. \"We hope, however, that the coordination would not be dragged out.\" A previous convoy carrying aid for civilians caught up in the fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions was sent over the border by Russia without permission from Ukrainian authorities. The Presidents of Russia and Ukraine are \"broadly satisfied\" with the status of the ceasefire, Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told Russia's Interfax news agency on Wednesday. CNN's Andrew Carey in Kiev and Alla Eshchenko in Moscow contributed to this report. CNN's James Frater also contributed.",
