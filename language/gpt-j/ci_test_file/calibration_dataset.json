        "input": "Dr. Conrad Murray was sentenced Tuesday to four years in the Los Angeles County jail -- the maximum sentence allowed under the law -- in the death of Michael Jackson. He may serve no more than two, however. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor, in a lengthy statement delivered before sentencing Murray for involuntary manslaughter, said he felt a significant responsibility to determine the appropriate sentence, utilizing his \"sense of fairness and decency.\" \"There are those who feel Dr. Murray is a saint,\" Judge Pastor said. \"There are those who feel Dr. Murray is the devil. He's neither. He's a human being. He stands convicted of the death of another human being.\" Automatic credit for good behavior lowers the actual time served to two years, which puts his projected release date in late 2013, Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Overheard on CNN.com: Is 4-year sentence fair? Murray is not eligible for early release electronic monitoring or house arrest, which some county prisoners get under a federal court order aimed at reducing jail overcrowding, Whitmore said.  \"He does not meet our requirements for any kind of home monitoring,\" he said. Members of Jackson's family, who sat in court for Tuesday's sentencing, appeared pleased with the judge's decision to ignore defense pleas for leniency. A statement from the family, read in court by a lawyer, said they were \"not here to seek revenge,\" but they wanted a sentence that \"reminds physicians that they cannot sell their services to the highest bidder and cast aside their Hippocratic oath to do no harm.\" It included a message to the judge from Jackson's three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket. \"We will grow up without a father, our best friend, our playmate and our dad,\" the children said. Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff acknowledged that it was unlikely Pastor would accept probation for Murray, but he still made a case for community service over time behind bars. \"He could do things for the community on probation that he could never do sitting in that little room,\" Chernoff said. Even without jail time, Chernoff said, he will suffer the rest of his life because of the loss of his medical career and the stigma of the conviction. \"Whether he is a barista the rest of his life, whether he is a greeter at Walmart, he's still going to be the man who killed Michael Jackson for the rest of his life,\" Chernoff said. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren, arguing for the maximum four years in jail, said Murray was \"playing Russian roulette with Michael Jackson's life every single night,\" by using the surgical anesthetic propofol to put him to sleep in \"a reckless, obscene manner.\" Murray showed his lack of remorse or acceptance of his personal responsibility in an interview nine days before he was found guilty, Walgren said. \"I don't feel guilty because I did not do anything wrong,\" Murray said in a documentary aired days after he was convicted. Pastor delivered a 30-minute explanation of why he was sentencing Murray to the maximum jail time, even though the doctor was technically eligible for probation. Murray's \"faux documentary\" made it appear he was just a \"bystander\" in Jackson's death who was \"entrapped\" and \"betrayed\" by his patient, Pastor said. \"Yikes!  Talk about blaming the victim,\" he said.  \"Not only isn't there any remorse, there's umbrage and outrage on the part of Dr. Murray against the decedent, without any, any indication of the slightest involvement in this case.\" Pastor said that while he had considered the entire \"book\" of Murray's life, he also had \"read the book of Michael Jackson's life.\" \"Regrettably, as far as Dr. Murray is concerned, the most significant chapter, as it relates to this case, is the chapter involving the treatment, or lack of treatment, of Michael Jackson.\" Jackson died \"not because of an isolated one-off occurrence or incident,\" Pastor said. \"He died because of a totality of circumstances which are directly attributable to Dr. Murray ... because of a series of decisions that Dr. Murray made.\" Murray, he said, became involved in \"a cycle of horrible medicine.\" He cited Murray's \"pattern of deceit and lies. That pattern was to assist Dr. Murray.\" A tape recording of Jackson's slurred voice was Murray's \"insurance policy,\" Pastor said. \"It was designed to record his patient surreptitiously at that patient's most vulnerable point. I can't even imagine that happening to any of us because of the horrific violation of trust.\" He said he wondered whether that tape would have been offered for sale, had Jackson not died and a rift had developed between the two in the future. One of the 12 jurors who found Murray guilty said in an interview airing Tuesday on HLN's \"Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell,\" that the recording did not play into the verdict. \"We talked about that audio a little bit,\" Debbie Franklin, known as \"Juror 5,\" said.  \"We didn't really understand why it was presented. I still do not understand what that was about.\" Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter three weeks ago after a trial in which prosecutors successfully argued that Murray's reckless use of propofol to help Jackson sleep, without proper monitoring equipment, led to the singer's death. \"We had decided the three issues we were going to focus on were the not calling 911, not having the medical equipment and him leaving the room,\" Franklin said.  \"That was the bottom line for this case.\" Testimony during the trial revealed that Murray gave propofol nearly every night in the two months before the singer's death on June 25, 2009, as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts set for London the next month. The judge set a hearing for January 23 to decide on the prosecution's request that Murray be ordered to pay Jackson's estate and his children more than $100 million in restitution for the \"wage and profits lost,\" as provided under California's \"victim's bill of rights\" law. The singer's \"estate estimates Michael Jackson's projected earnings for the 50-show O2 concert series to be $100 million,\" the prosecutors said. With nearly $2 million in funeral expenses and 10% interest added each year, the prosecution is asking Pastor to order Murray to pay Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson more than $120 million in restitution. While it is doubtful that Murray, who is unlikely to ever practice medicine again, could pay very much of that sum, it could prevent him from reaping financial benefits from any books, interviews or film projects in the future.",

        "input": "Roughly half the schedulers at multiple Veterans Affairs hospitals said they received instructions from supervisors to falsify data and hide the true time it took patients to be seen by a doctor after making an appointment, new details from an internal VA audit show. Schedulers said supervisors directed them to manipulate information so their centers could meet performance goals, which would help top officials get bonuses, according to documents obtained by CNN. The new information also provided to Congress this week includes updates from specific VA hospitals that were not included in an internal audit released last month by the embattled agency. The ongoing saga involves multiple investigations into delayed care, potentially with deadly results, alarming management shortcomings and a culture that was said to have compromised the mission of providing prompt and effective medical care to millions of veterans, some of them returning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. New VA secretary confirmed . VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned over the scandal in May. His replacement, Robert McDonald, was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday unanimously. The former corporate CEO and ex-Army officer has pledged to swiftly introduce reforms. Under pressure from constituents back home and most members facing voters in November, Congress is poised to approve a $17 billion bipartisan proposal before the week is out. It would allow the agency to hire more medical staff, lease new facilities, and give veterans the opportunity to seek care outside the VA system. It would also allow the VA secretary to more easily fire top officials. Details of delayed care were first reported by CNN in an investigation of two VA hospitals in the Southeast. Since, CNN reporting has expanded to include more hospitals and details of delayed care and allegations that up to 40 deaths were tied to the problem. Congress comes up with a deal on veterans . Greater range of problems . While the Phoenix VA medical center has received the most national scrutiny, the new information shows in greater depth a range of problems affecting numerous facilities nationwide. VA hospitals in Montgomery, Alabama, Clarksburg, West Virginia, and White City, Oregon, were among the worst cited in the new information. About 50% of schedulers at those facilities reported being told by their superiors to falsify data. Moreover, schedulers in Washington, Richmond, Gainesville, Florida, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and elsewhere used \"outside tracking logs\" to hide long delays in care by not properly recording information in the scheduling system, the documents showed. Numerous other VA medical centers may have improperly used \"paper wait lists\" or excel spreadsheets to hide delays, according to the new internal audit details. Data from the audit released last month found that 13% of schedulers surveyed nationally said they were directed by hospital administrators to enter appointment dates that were different from those requested by a veteran. But the newly released data showed 55 of the VA medical centers audited had more than 13% of schedulers reporting such direction, the documents showed. Bad VA care may have killed more than 1,000 veterans, senator's report says . Coaching schedulers . Scheduling staff training has been controversial throughout recent investigations of VA management. The audit also showed that half of schedulers surveyed could not remember the date of their last training. The findings also showed there were attempts to coach and prepare staff and schedulers in a number of cases before they were questioned by auditors. House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller said any VA administrator who ordered employees to purposely manipulate patient wait times should be immediately fired. \"The environment in today's Veterans Health Administration is one in which some VA executives are so driven in their quest for performance bonuses, promotions and power that they are willing to lie, cheat and put the health of the veterans they were hired to serve at risk,\" Miller said. Gingrich Opinion: We owe our veterans real change . VA takes action . The VA said in a statement on its website on Tuesday that it had proposed \"a series of disciplinary\" actions against six employees in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Fort Collins, Colorado, as a result of the audit. \"Employees who have been found to have manipulated data, withheld accurate information from their supervisors, and affected the timeliness of care veterans receive do not reflect VA's values, and their actions will not be tolerated,\" said Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson. Carolyn Lerner, head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, said, \"We are encouraged by the VA's action in response to Office of Special Counsel's reports regarding whistleblower disclosures of manipulated wait-time data that masked scheduling problems at the VA's Cheyenne and Fort Collins facilities.\" The office is charged with representing whistleblowers across the country. Who is Bob McDonald? Veterans waiting longer for cancer care . 'Corrosive culture,' weak leadership cripple VA, report says .",

        "input": "(CNN) -- Real Madrid reduced Barcelona's Spanish league lead to two points with a comfortable 2-0 victory at home to lowly Levante on Saturday, reaching a remarkable milestone for coach Jose Mourinho. First-half goals from Karim Benzema and Ricardo Carvalho were enough to give Mourinho's team a 19th victory in 24 La Liga games this season. The victory extended Real's unbeaten home La Liga run under Mourinho to 12 matches -- now 148 in total since his only career home league defeat when in charge of Porto on February 23, 2002. Mourinho has carried his incredible record through spells with English club Chelsea and European champions Inter Milan into his first season at the Santiago Bernabeu. Spanish titleholders Barcelona will seek to bounce back from Tuesday's Champions League defeat by Arsenal and last weekend's surprise draw with Sporting Gijon when Athletic Bilbao visit the Camp Nou on Sunday. Benzema, meanwhile, staked his claim for a starting place against his former club Lyon this coming Tuesday, when Real travel to France seeking revenge for last season's last-16 defeat in Europe's top club competition. Lyon warm up for Real clash with win . The 23-year-old has been vying for a place with loan signing Emmanuel Adebayor in the absence of the injured Gonzalo Higuain, and he scored his third league goal this season from close range after a superb run down the right by winger Angel Di Maria. Real dominated after that sixth-minute opener, and the second goal came four minutes before halftime when veteran Portugal defender Carvalho diverted in a vicious Cristiano Ronaldo free-kick for his third La Liga goal since leaving Chelsea in August. Second-half substitute Adebayor thought he had made it 3-0 in time added on, but Ronaldo was ruled to have been offside as he sought to pounce on a blocked shot from another replacement, Mesut Ozil. \"I liked that my team played a serious match. These games ahead of Champions League matches can be complicated because players may focus more on the European competition,\" Mourinho told reporters. \"The team played well and was very focused. We knew Levante would make it tough. They were organized in defense, but we scored early and had things under control. Winning and resting players is what mattered.\" The defeat left Levante two points above the bottom three, with the Valencia-based team hoping to avoid an immediate return to the second division. Third-placed Valencia lost ground on Madrid following a 0-0 draw at home to Sporting Gijon, who ended the day above 16th-placed Levante on goal difference. That result means fellow Champions League hopefuls Villarreal can draw level on 48 points with a win at home to bottom club Malaga on Sunday. Fifth-placed Atletico Madrid won 1-0 at Real Zaragoza in Saturday's late match, thanks to Sergio Aguero's second-half winner. The Argentine striker broke the deadlock with a flash of brilliance in the 65th minute as he received Diego Forlan's pass, burst into the penalty box and fired a low shot across the keeper and into the far corner. Zaragoza could have snatched a point, but Nigerian striker Ikechukwu Uche and on-loan Argentine midfielder Nicolas Bertolo both saw late efforts rebound off the Madrid crossbar. Zaragoza remained a point above third-bottom Osasuna, who host sixth-placed Espanyol on Sunday.",

        "input": "(CNN)  -- The head of the U.N. Children's Fund has expressed concern over a Saudi judge's refusal for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8-year-old girl and a 47-year-old man. UNICEF's Ann Veneman said consent cannot be free if either party is too young to make an informed decision. \"Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework, the marriage of a child is a violation of that child's rights,\" said Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF. \"The right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consent cannot be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision.\" The most recent ruling, in which the judge upheld his original verdict, was handed down Saturday in the Saudi city of Onaiza, where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl's mother, seeking a divorce for her daughter. Have your say by clicking here . A relative said the judge, Sheikh Habib al-Habib, \"stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty.\" The family member, who requested anonymity, added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter. The case, which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups, came to light in December when al-Habib declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality. The judge ruled that the girl's mother -- who is separated from her father -- was not the girl's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court, Abdullah al-Jutaili, the mother's attorney, told CNN at the time. The girl's father, according to the lawyer, arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man, who is a close friend of his. At the time of the initial verdict, the judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili told CNN. The judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty, she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court, the lawyer said. Last month, an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh declined to certify the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib's verdict, and sent the case back to him for reconsideration. Under the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect, but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing. The appeals court in Riyadh will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month, according to the relative. The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently. While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages, the kingdom's top cleric has said that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. \"It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,\" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in remarks last January, according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. \"A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong, and they are being unfair to her.\" Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry. \"We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,\" he said, according to the newspaper. \"We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women.\" Sharia law is Islamic law. Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism. CNN was unable to reach government officials for comment. Christoph Wilcke, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, told CNN in December that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages. \"We've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men,\" Wilcke said. Wilcke said that although Saudi ministries might make decisions designed to protect children, \"It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts, and in many realms beyond the court.\" In December, Zuhair al-Harithi, a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission, said his organization is fighting against child marriages. \"The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia,\" al-Harithi said. \"Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed.\" He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place. Wajeha al-Huwaider, co-founder of the Society of Defending Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, told CNN that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to \"keep us backward and in the dark ages.\" She said the marriages cause girls to \"lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression.\"",
